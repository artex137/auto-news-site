      <h2>T-Swift Smashes Joe Rogan’s Trump Podcast Ratings in First Hour on Her Boyfriend’s Show</h2>

<p>In an unprecedented twist of fate that has left pundits and fans alike scrambling for answers, Taylor Swift's podcast appearance on the New Heights show with boyfriend Jason Kelce has obliterated the ratings of Donald Trump’s much-publicized episode on The Joe Rogan Experience. The numbers are staggering: 1.3 million viewers tuned in live to witness the first hour of Swift’s interview, a figure that nearly doubles the 800,000 who watched Trump’s episode during its initial hour last October. Is this the dawn of a new era in podcasting, or just another fleeting moment in the celebrity stratosphere?</p>

<p>The jaw-dropping numbers were reported on Wednesday, October 4, 2023, and confirmed by Swift’s representatives. According to CNN data analyst Harry Enten, the New Heights podcast is “already on track to become one of the most watched podcasts of all time.” This is not just a minor blip on the radar; it’s a seismic event that has sent shockwaves through the media landscape.</p>

<p>The chaos reached a fever pitch when Swift’s fans, affectionately dubbed "Swifties," crashed YouTube at the 1 hour and 44-minute mark of the broadcast, flooding the comments section with their excitement. “Shoutout all the 92%ers and Swifties for actually helping us break the internet,” the New Heights X account gleefully proclaimed. For those not in the know, the Kelce brothers refer to their podcast fans as “92 percenters” as a nod to the success rate of a quarterback sneak. It’s a clever play on words, but it’s also a testament to the power of celebrity culture in today’s media.</p>

<p>As the numbers continue to climb, it’s worth noting that Swift’s New Heights episode had over 6 million views just five hours after its release. In stark contrast, Trump’s episode has garnered a whopping 59 million views since it aired, making it one of the most-watched episodes in Rogan's history. However, the comparisons only serve to highlight the meteoric rise of Swift’s influence in the podcasting realm. To put this into perspective, the most-watched Rogan episode of all time features Elon Musk, who has racked up an astounding 69 million views since his 2018 appearance.</p>

<p>Despite the overwhelming success of the New Heights podcast, it’s important to remember that it was not even in the Top 100 of YouTube’s podcast chart last week, as it had been on hiatus until Swift’s episode was released. The most popular episode prior to this featured Jason Kelce’s wife, Kylie, which has amassed 8.6 million views since its release in 2023. With Swift’s episode now dominating the conversation, one has to wonder if this is the beginning of a new chapter for New Heights.</p>

<p>In a moment that feels straight out of an ’80s John Hughes movie, Swift reminisced about how instrumental Kelce's comments on the podcast were in their relationship. “This kind of felt more like I was in an ’80s John Hughes movie,” she quipped, adding, “He was just like standing outside of my window with a boom box just being like, ‘I want to date you. Do you want to go on a date with me? I made you a friendship bracelet. Do you want to date me?’” It’s a charming anecdote, but one can’t help but feel that this is more than just a personal story; it’s a calculated move in the ever-evolving game of celebrity branding.</p>

<p>In a stunning display of synergy, Swift also used the podcast as a platform to announce the upcoming release of her 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl, set to drop on October 3, 2023. With all 12 tracks reportedly created in Sweden alongside producers Max Martin and Shellback, fans are buzzing with anticipation. This is a strategic move that not only capitalizes on the podcast’s momentum but also further intertwines her brand with that of the NFL star.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Trump’s relationship with Swift has been anything but cordial. Following her endorsement of Kamala Harris for president, Trump has been vocal about his disdain for the pop star, even going so far as to declare her “no longer hot” in a May Truth Social post. The animosity reached a crescendo during the Super Bowl when Trump compared crowd reactions to himself and Swift, highlighting the divide between their respective fan bases. “I watched in person,” he recalled, “I was there along with Taylor Swift, how did that work out?”</p>

<p>The Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment, but one thing is clear: the podcasting landscape has irrevocably shifted. With Swift’s record-breaking debut on New Heights, we’re left to ponder the implications of celebrity power in the digital age. Are we witnessing the rise of a new podcast queen, or is this merely a flash in the pan? Only time will tell, but for now, the numbers speak for themselves.</p>
