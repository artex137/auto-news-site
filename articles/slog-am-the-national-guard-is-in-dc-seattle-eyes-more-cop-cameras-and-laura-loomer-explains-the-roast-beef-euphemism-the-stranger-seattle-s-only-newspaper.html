      <h2>Slog AM: The National Guard Is in DC, Seattle Eyes More Cop Cameras, and Laura Loomer Explains the Roast Beef Euphemism</h2>

<p>Hold onto your hats, folks! The surveillance state is tightening its grip, and it seems that our government is more interested in monitoring its citizens than actually addressing the issues at hand. Just last night, in a move that can only be described as a grotesque overreach, the National Guard landed in Washington, D.C. on the orders of former President Donald Trump. The reason? To combat “crime, bloodshed, bedlam and squalor and worse”—words that echo through the annals of absurdity, especially when considering that crime in D.C. is currently at a 30-year low!</p>

<p>According to the ever-reliable Karoline Leavitt, a spokesperson whose credibility is about as solid as wet tissue paper, “850 officers and agents were surged across the city.” What did this massive deployment yield? A whopping 23 arrests, one of which was for “fare evasion”—truly the most heinous of offenses. “The subway literally cried,” as if the very essence of public transport could shed tears over such a “violent” crime. If this isn’t a classic case of using a sledgehammer to crack a nut, I don’t know what is.</p>

<p>But wait! There’s more! Leavitt went on to assure us that these agents will “relentlessly pursue and arrest every violent criminal in the district.” This raises a glaring question: if over 70 percent of the tens of thousands of detainees arrested this year had NO criminal convictions, who exactly are they “relentlessly pursuing”? Perhaps they should consider a different career path—one that doesn’t involve trampling on civil liberties.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a shocking twist, the Seattle Times reports that ICE arrests have plummeted by 25 percent between June and July. But don’t let that fool you! A staggering 218 immigrants were still arrested in Washington in July, the highest number recorded since September 2023. It seems the surveillance state is not just a D.C. problem; it’s spreading like an invasive weed across the country.</p>

<p>And speaking of invasive measures, look no further than Seattle’s City Council, which is set to consider a proposal on September 2 to install more police cameras throughout the city. New cameras are planned for the Capitol Hill area, especially around East Pike and Cal Anderson Park, as well as the stadium district—just in time for next year’s FIFA World Cup. Mayor Bruce Harrell is reportedly in love with the idea. But let’s face it: Harrell’s affection for more surveillance is about as charming as a root canal.</p>

<p>In other news, the election results are rolling in, and Katie Wilson is triumphantly holding 50.71 percent of the vote in last week’s primaries. The Stranger’s endorsements seem to be paying off, as all but two of the candidates we backed are winning their races. So, let’s take a moment to bask in our own glory! Why didn’t you listen to us about Kim-Khánh Văn, you ding-dongs?!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a chilling reminder of our government’s obsession with controlling other people’s bodies, Gerika Mudra, an 18-year-old cis woman from Minnesota, is suing Buffalo Wild Wings for discrimination after a server allegedly harassed her in the women’s restroom. The audacity! She was reportedly held hostage until she “proved” her gender. Is this really where we are headed as a society? It’s enough to make any reasonable person shudder.</p>

<p>In international news, Trump is set to meet with Putin at a U.S. military base in Anchorage this Friday to discuss ending the war in Ukraine. Trump has promised “very severe” consequences if Russia doesn’t cease its attacks. Sounds familiar? It’s the same ominous rhetoric we’ve heard before—back in January, April, and now again. Will anything change? Only time will tell.</p>

<p>On the environmental front, we have alarming reports from Juneau, Alaska, where a "glacial outburst" is threatening significant flooding. This isn't just a one-off incident; it’s happened every August for the past three years, with last year’s flood surge damaging over 100 homes. CNN has confirmed that this is yet another consequence of climate change due to fossil fuel pollution. Yet, shockingly, there are still morons out there claiming otherwise!</p>

<p>In a final twist of the knife, President Trump announced this year’s Kennedy Center Honorees, which include George Strait, Michael Crawford, Gloria Gaynor, Kiss, and Sylvester Stallone. Honestly, how did Big Balls not make the cut? It’s a travesty!</p>

<p>And if you missed it, a fire over the weekend ravaged the Get Nice Gallery and other studios in Ballard Commons on Market Street, just as they were preparing for the Ballard Art Walk. Most, if not all, of the artwork has been destroyed. The community is mourning this loss, and we should all take a moment to reflect on the fragility of our cultural institutions.</p>

<p>As for something lighter, Laura Loomer’s deposition in her suit against Bill Maher is making waves—filled with gems that are sure to entertain. And just when you thought it couldn’t get any weirder, scientists announced the discovery of a new whale species, Janjucetus dullardi, from a 25-million-year-old fossil in Australia. It’s “deceptively cute” and equipped with sharp teeth. Sounds like a metaphor for our current political climate!</p>

<p>So buckle up! As we navigate this chaotic landscape of surveillance, political absurdity, and cultural tragedies, one thing is clear: we’re in for one hell of a ride!</p>
