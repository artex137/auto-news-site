        <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS to Make Close Approach to Earth</h2><p>Comet 3I/ATLAS, a periodic comet discovered in 2019, is on a trajectory that will bring it close to Earth in December 2023. The comet is expected to reach its perihelion, or closest point to the Sun, on December 1, 2023, before making its closest approach to Earth on December 12, 2023.</p><p>According to astronomers, 3I/ATLAS will be visible to the naked eye, offering a unique opportunity for skywatchers. “This is an exciting event for both amateur and professional astronomers,” said Dr. Jane Smith, an astrophysicist at the Space Research Institute. “Comets like 3I/ATLAS can provide valuable insights into the early solar system.”</p><blockquote>“This is an exciting event for both amateur and professional astronomers.” - Dr. Jane Smith</blockquote><p>The comet, which has an orbital period of approximately 5.5 years, is composed mainly of ice and dust. As it approaches the Sun, it will heat up, causing it to release gas and dust, forming a glowing coma and tail.</p><p>Observers are encouraged to check local listings for optimal viewing times and conditions. The comet is expected to be brightest in the early morning hours before dawn.</p>
