<h2>Lawyers Banned from MSG: A Facial Recognition Fiasco</h2>

<p>In a shocking turn of events, Madison Square Garden (MSG), the iconic arena owned by none other than James Dolan, has implemented a facial recognition policy that has left a trail of bewildered lawyers and stunned fans. The policy, which has been in place since 2022, is designed to keep critics at bay, but it seems to have turned into a spectacle of absurdity and paranoia.</p>

<p>Seth Diamond, a personal injury lawyer from the powerhouse firm Morgan & Morgan, was recently denied entry to a Rangers game while on vacation in New York City with his young son. Imagine the scene: a young boy in tears as his father is turned away at the gate. “Remember,” Diamond reportedly told his son, “the person who made this decision — they have more money than probably anyone you’ll ever meet in your life … But they’re doing things that aren’t good.”</p>

<p>This heart-wrenching experience is just one of countless tales from the over 1,000 lawyers banned from MSG and its affiliated venues, including Radio City Music Hall. According to a report by ESPN, Dolan’s bold move to use facial recognition technology to identify and exclude critics has resulted in a staggering number of bans from roughly 90 law firms across the nation. A spokeswoman for MSG, however, dismissed the report, calling it a “total hack story.”</p>

<blockquote>“They came running over like the ‘Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,’ with their fingers on their earpieces,” said Frank Miller Jr., a former Hot 97 radio art director who was booted from a concert at Radio City Music Hall.</blockquote>

<p>Miller, who designed a “BAN DOLAN” t-shirt, was handed a “trespass notice” while his mother watched in disbelief. This isn’t just an isolated incident; lawyers have found themselves banned from high-profile events, including comedy shows and basketball games, all because of this draconian policy.</p>

<p>Take Justin Brandel, for instance. He was gifted orchestra-level tickets to see comedians John Oliver and Seth Meyers at the Beacon Theatre, only to have to explain to his parents that he couldn’t attend. “I didn’t want to give the MSG Company the satisfaction of kicking me out without any refunds,” Brandel lamented. His parents ended up taking friends instead, leaving Brandel to stew in his frustration.</p>

<p>Then there’s Nicolette Landi, a personal injury lawyer who received a $375 ticket to Mariah Carey’s Holiday concert. Her excitement quickly turned to shock when facial recognition technology identified her before she even made it through security. “As soon as my bag was going through the [conveyor] belt, there were 10 security guards around me,” she recounted. “Yeah, it’s her,” one guard said after checking her ID, leading to her swift removal from the venue.</p>

<blockquote>“Oh my God, what did you do?” her husband asked, as they were ushered outside.</blockquote>

<p>In a twist of irony, Landi ended up purchasing a counterfeit Mariah Carey t-shirt outside the venue because she couldn’t get an official one. This is the absurdity of Dolan's policy — lawyers simply trying to enjoy a night out are treated like criminals.</p>

<p>Dan Watts, another lawyer from Morgan & Morgan, faced a similar fate when he attended a St. John’s Red Storm NCAA basketball game on December 16, 2023. Just as he and his family settled into their ground-floor seats at MSG, security recognized him and promptly ejected him from the event. The policy is clear: if you’re involved in any litigation against MSG, you’re deemed “hostile” and not welcome.</p>

<p>James Dolan, who is currently defending MSG against 19 active lawsuits, has staunchly defended this controversial policy. “If there’s someone you don’t want to serve, you get to say, ‘I don’t want to serve you,’” Dolan remarked during an interview in January 2023. “If there’s somebody who is suing you and trying to put you out of business or take your money from you … You have a right to be, yes, a little unhappy about it.”</p>

<p>MSG Entertainment has claimed that their policies are in place to ensure the safety and security of patrons, stating, “Millions of customers come to MSG and its related venues every year. Our policies are designed to ensure their comfort and enjoyment at every event.” But is it really about safety, or is it a blatant attempt to silence dissent?</p>

<p>As the outrage continues to build, one has to wonder: how far will Dolan go to protect his empire? With more than 1,000 lawyers banned, it seems that the MSG exclusion list is becoming a modern-day blacklist — a chilling reminder of how power and wealth can corrupt the very institutions meant to entertain and unite us.</p>

<p>As the saga unfolds, one thing is clear: the battle between Dolan and the legal community is just beginning, and the ramifications of this facial recognition fiasco could be felt for years to come. Will lawyers continue to be targeted for merely doing their jobs? Only time will tell, but for now, the MSG gates remain firmly closed to those deemed “hostile.”</p>
