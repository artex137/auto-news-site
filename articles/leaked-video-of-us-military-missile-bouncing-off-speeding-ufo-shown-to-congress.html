      <h2>Leaked video of US military missile ‘bouncing’ off speeding UFO shown to Congress</h2>

<p>On 9 September 2024, a House Oversight subcommittee hearing revealed leaked footage showing a US military Hellfire missile appearing to ‘bounce’ off a shiny object off the coast of Yemen on 30 October 2024. No injuries or fatalities have been reported in connection with the incident.</p>

<p>This video, presented by Rep. Eric Burlison of Missouri, has raised significant interest regarding Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), the military's term for UFOs. During the hearing, military whistleblowers testified under oath about their encounters with UFOs and accused the government of covering up information related to these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 30 October 2024, a US military Hellfire missile was fired at a shiny object off the coast of Yemen. The incident was captured on video, which has since been shared with Congress.</p>
