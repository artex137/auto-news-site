      <h2>Exclusive / Taliban ‘colluding’ with senior UN officials to divert aid, new report finds</h2>

<p>In an explosive revelation that raises serious questions about the integrity of international aid efforts in Afghanistan, the US government’s Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) has released a damning report alleging that the Taliban is “colluding” with senior United Nations officials to siphon off international aid meant for the Afghan populace. This startling information was unveiled on Wednesday, as SIGAR prepares to conclude its operations next year after nearly 15 years of monitoring US involvement in the reconstruction of Afghanistan following the 2001 invasion.</p>

<p>The report, which was first shared with Semafor, paints a grim picture of the Taliban's manipulation of aid resources. “We knew that US aid dollars were specifically, directly and indirectly, benefiting the Taliban,” a senior State Department official revealed, highlighting the shocking depth of the corruption. “What was surprising to me is how integrated many of the NGOs, in particular, the United Nations, were into some of this diversion and corruption.”</p>

<p>In a country where humanitarian aid is a lifeline for millions, the report asserts that the Taliban’s restrictive laws have created an environment that not only stifles non-governmental organizations (NGOs) but also facilitates the diversion of aid. Disturbingly, minority populations in Afghanistan have reportedly been served “spoiled or rotten food” due to these corrupt practices, with the Taliban allegedly interfering in NGO hiring processes to ensure that their own candidates are favored.</p>

<p>The origins of this crisis can be traced back to the Trump administration, which set the stage for US withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2020. Following Trump’s signing of an agreement with Taliban representatives, President Joe Biden’s chaotic pullout in 2021 culminated in the tragic death of 13 US troops during a terrorist attack. Since then, Trump has effectively terminated most US aid to Afghanistan, dismantling the US Agency for International Development and reconfiguring the State Department.</p>

<blockquote>“At least 20 percent of the employees of international NGOs were affiliated with the Taliban.”</blockquote>
<p>This alarming statistic, shared by an NGO worker with SIGAR, underscores the pervasive infiltration of the Taliban into organizations meant to aid the Afghan people. The report further details how the Taliban require NGOs to place individuals on their payrolls, collecting salaries without ever showing up for work. This is not merely a case of bureaucratic inefficiency; it is a calculated strategy to enrich the Taliban while leaving the Afghan populace in dire need.</p>

<p>The SIGAR report also alleges that the Taliban have engaged in collusion with UN officials to extort bribes from UN contractors, splitting the profits among themselves. “Most of the allegations SIGAR heard involved employees of the World Food Programme, which has been the largest single recipient of both US and overall aid to Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover,” the report states. It paints a picture of a corrupt system where humanitarian aid is not just mismanaged but actively exploited.</p>

<blockquote>“They’re able to divert US aid dollars, both in the form of currency going through the UN cash shipments, as well as in the form of services and goods for their own benefit.”</blockquote>
<p>These revelations are not just shocking; they are a clarion call for accountability. The report suggests that a staggering “30 to 40 percent” of total donor funds sent to Afghanistan actually reach their intended recipients, raising serious concerns about the efficacy of aid distribution. Despite nearly $4 billion in US aid provided since August 2021, the situation on the ground remains dire, with many Afghans still suffering the consequences of this egregious misappropriation of resources.</p>

<p>As the UN has yet to respond to these allegations, SIGAR's acting inspector general, Gene Aloise, has pointed out a troubling “culture of denial within the international aid community” regarding the Taliban's misuse of assistance dollars. This culture of denial not only undermines the integrity of aid efforts but also places countless lives at risk.</p>

<p>With SIGAR's recommendations now on the table, including calls for US agencies to have full access to UN performance and financial reporting, the time for action is now. The US has a responsibility to ensure that aid reaches those who need it most, without lining the pockets of corrupt officials, whether they be Taliban members or UN representatives.</p>

<p>The implications of this report extend well beyond Afghanistan’s borders. As international observers and policymakers grapple with the fallout from these revelations, one thing is clear: the integrity of humanitarian aid in conflict zones is at stake, and the world cannot afford to turn a blind eye to the collusion that puts lives in jeopardy.</p>

<p>As SIGAR prepares to close its doors, the questions it raises linger: How has this collusion been allowed to flourish? What will be done to address the corruption that has infiltrated the very organizations designed to help those in need? The answers may be uncomfortable, but they are necessary if we are to restore faith in the international aid system.</p>
