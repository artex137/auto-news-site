      <h2>Google’s Shocking Admission: They Can’t Trust Social Media Signals!</h2>

<p>In a jaw-dropping revelation, Google’s very own Gary Illyes has candidly admitted that the tech titan refuses to utilize social media metrics as ranking signals for its search algorithms. This revelation came during a recent interview with Japanese search marketing expert Kenichi Suzuki, where Illyes stated unequivocally, “For this we have basically a very old, very canned response... The answer is no. And for the future is also likely no.”</p>

<p>What does this mean for the millions of digital marketers and SEO specialists worldwide? It’s a slap in the face to those who have been banking on the idea that social media shares and views could catapult their content to the top of Google search results. Alas, it seems the social media dream is nothing more than a mirage in the desert of digital marketing!</p>

<h2>The Reason Behind Google’s Reluctance</h2>

<p>Illyes, who has a history of dispelling SEO myths, made it clear that Google’s refusal to consider social signals stems from a fundamental need for control. “We need to be able to control our own signals. And if we are looking at external signals... that’s not in our control,” he explained. This begs the question: if Google can’t control it, can we trust it?</p>

<p>Indeed, the specter of manipulation looms large. Imagine a scenario where social media influencers artificially inflate their post engagement to gain favor in Google’s algorithm. Illyes highlighted this concern, stating, “if someone on that social network decides to inflate the number, we don’t know if that inflation was legit or not.” Talk about opening a Pandora’s box!</p>

<h2>SEO Experts React: What Does This Mean for the Industry?</h2>

<p>Industry experts are reeling from Illyes' declaration. Rio Ichikawa, another prominent figure from Faber Company, posed the pivotal question that sparked this enlightening exchange. The implications of Illyes' response are enormous. If social signals are off the table, what other factors might be influencing Google’s rankings that we don’t yet know about?</p>

<p>Kenichi Suzuki, who has spent over 25 years immersed in digital marketing, previously revealed insights into what qualities Google Discover favors. But can we trust these insights now that the social media power-players are effectively sidelined? It’s enough to make any SEO professional’s head spin!</p>

<h2>Are Structured Data and Author Bylines Next on the Chopping Block?</h2>

<p>Adding fuel to the fire, Illyes pointed out that while Google does use structured data, it is not as a ranking factor but merely to make sites eligible for rich results. “Yes, Google uses structured data, but not as a ranking factor; they just make websites eligible for rich results,” Illyes clarified. This is a crucial distinction that could leave many SEOs scrambling to reassess their strategies.</p>

<p>Furthermore, John Mueller, another Google stalwart, has publicly criticized the now-defunct LLMs.txt protocol for its unreliability and potential for abuse. He likened it to the infamous keywords meta tag—once a staple of SEO that was easily manipulated. “To me, it’s comparable to the keywords meta tag – this is what a site-owner claims their site is about... why not just check the site directly?” Mueller quipped. Ouch!</p>

<p>The irony doesn’t end there. Many SEOs have also pushed for author bylines as a means of establishing authority, only to have some resort to creating fake LinkedIn profiles to bolster their credibility. The ease of such manipulation should have raised red flags about using author bylines as a ranking signal. It’s almost laughable if it weren’t so tragic!</p>

<h2>The SEO Community Must Rethink Its Strategies</h2>

<p>Illyes' emphatic statement, “we need to be able to control our own signals,” is a clarion call for the SEO community to reevaluate their beliefs and practices. The era of relying on dubious external signals is over. As Illyes suggests, the focus should shift toward creating genuine, user-centric experiences that actually resonate with audiences.</p>

<p>In a world where misinformation spreads like wildfire, the need for trustworthy ranking signals has never been more critical. The SEO community must now grapple with these revelations and adapt accordingly. As we move forward into an uncertain digital landscape, one thing is clear: Google is tightening its grip on what constitutes reliable signals, and the days of gaming the system may be numbered.</p>

<blockquote>“If that’s true, then what about structured data? Those are under the control of SEOs, but Google uses them.” – The SEO community must now ponder the implications of this statement.</blockquote>

<p>As we digest these revelations, one thing remains certain: the game of SEO is changing, and those who fail to adapt may find themselves left in the dust. Whether you’re an SEO veteran or a newcomer to the field, it’s time to rethink your strategies and embrace a new era of algorithmic transparency.</p>
