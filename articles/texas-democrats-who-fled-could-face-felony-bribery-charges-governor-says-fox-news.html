<h2>Texas Democrats Who Fled Could Face Felony Bribery Charges, Governor Says</h2>

<p>In a dramatic twist that has the political world buzzing, Texas Governor Greg Abbott has dropped a bombshell: the Democratic lawmakers who fled the state to disrupt redistricting efforts could be staring down the barrel of felony bribery charges! In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital, Abbott, who is no stranger to the political arena, suggested that these AWOL Democrats might have accepted money to abandon their posts and break quorum. Yes, you heard it right—money for mischief!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There had been some identification of some people paying for it,” Abbott explained, raising eyebrows and questions alike. “I’ve got to tell you, it raises a serious legal question for these officeholders, and that is, they were promised money if they did break quorum. That would be a bribe that could lead to a felony charge.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the political drama unfolds, Abbott revealed that Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton is hot on the trail of this alleged bribery scandal. “That also is something that the Texas attorney general is investigating and actually even got a temporary injunction from a court stopping any more money being given to these House members because of the potential bribe consequences,” Abbott stated.</p>

<p>What’s more, a Tarrant County District Judge, Megan Fahey, issued a temporary restraining order last Friday against the infamous Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke and his group, Powered by People, halting their “unlawful fundraising practices” that reportedly funded the fugitive Democrats’ air travel, lodging, and daily fines. Yes, folks, it looks like the Democrats might have been living large while avoiding their responsibilities!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In her order, Fahey declared, “Defendants have and will continue to engage in unlawful fundraising practices and utilization of political funds in a manner that either directly violates or causes Texas Democratic Legislators to violate [the law].” She went on to say that contributors to the group “have and continue to suffer irreparable harm through these unlawful acts because they are making political contributions that are being used to fund personal expenses and violate state law.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the stakes rising, Abbott issued a stark warning: “These House members are going to be facing not just the challenges of having to come back and deal with the consequences of their failure to be here but also deal with potential bribery charges against them.” The Texas GOP is on a rampage, seeking to “domesticate” these rogue Democrats who dared to break quorum, even considering nationwide civil arrest warrants. The audacity!</p>

<p>As the Texas Senate passed the contentious redistricting bill on August 4, 2025, the stakes couldn't be higher. If the bill clears both chambers and receives Abbott's signature, Republicans could gain an estimated five additional seats in Congress. However, the Democrats are still lurking in the shadows, hoping to thwart this maneuver.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“If they are, they will be arrested and taken to the Texas Capitol to try to make quorum,” Abbott declared, with law enforcement “scouring the streets of Texas right now.” He emphasized, “There are 88 Republicans who are ready and able to work. We need 12 Democrats to show up.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The fallout from this political saga has drawn sharp criticism from Democratic leaders and governors across the nation. California Governor Gavin Newsom has jumped into the fray, accusing Abbott of overreach and calling for him to back down. “You are not ‘entitled’ to 5 congressional seats,” Newsom fumed, threatening swift action should Abbott continue down this path.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In a fiery post on social media, Newsom declared, “CALIFORNIA WILL NOW DRAW NEW, MORE ‘BEAUTIFUL MAPS,’ THEY WILL BE HISTORIC AS THEY WILL END THE TRUMP PRESIDENCY (DEMS TAKE BACK THE HOUSE!).” Talk about a rallying cry!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Abbott, however, remains undeterred, stating, “Listen, these Democrats in other states are just completely out of control.” He accused Democrats of gerrymandering for decades in states like California, Illinois, and New York, while defending Texas’ redistricting plans as legally sound. “What we’re doing in our state is to make sure that we are going to have the districts represented by people who actually represent these voters,” he asserted.</p>

<p>As we await the next chapter in this unfolding drama, one thing is clear: the political stakes in Texas are higher than ever. Will the fleeing Democrats return to face the music? Will they be charged with bribery? And will Abbott’s redistricting plans go unchallenged? Only time will tell, but you can bet we’ll be watching closely!</p>
