      <h2>Michael Cohen Just Admitted Something About Trump and Epstein — And the Media Won’t Touch It</h2>

<p>Welcome back to The Red Letter, where the truth is as elusive as it is critical. The saga surrounding Jeffrey Epstein, the notorious sex trafficker, is not just a tale of political intrigue; it's a sordid web of exploitation that has left survivors yearning for justice. For too long, the mainstream media has tiptoed around the delicate truths of this case, but recent admissions by Michael Cohen, Donald Trump’s former fixer, have thrown a spotlight on a dark corner that demands scrutiny.</p>

<p>This past weekend, during an appearance on MSNBC, Cohen made a stunning declaration: there’s “no way” Trump ever visited Epstein’s infamous island. His reasoning? Trump has denied it “more than five, six times.” But hold on just a second! Cohen, who is no stranger to controversy, might be playing a dangerous game of misdirection here. After all, he spent a whopping 12 years in Trump's inner circle, even if those years didn't coincide with Epstein's notorious activities. What’s more, Cohen's defense of Trump raises eyebrows, especially when he went on to question a Wall Street Journal report that claimed Trump gifted Epstein a card adorned with a “suggestive doodle.”</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that Cohen insisted Trump doesn’t doodle or use the word “enigma.” However, these claims crumble under scrutiny: Trump’s doodles have fetched impressive sums at Sotheby’s, and he has indeed used the term “enigma” on record. So, why is Cohen so eager to shield Trump from scrutiny? It’s a curious case of loyalty in the face of potentially explosive allegations.</p>

<p>Let’s rewind to 2016, a year that would go down in infamy not just for the elections but for the allegations that surfaced against Trump. A Jane Doe, known only as “Katie Johnson,” accused Trump of raping her at Epstein’s Manhattan townhouse when she was just 13 years old. This was not a mere whisper; Johnson filed three lawsuits against Trump, but days before the election, she mysteriously dropped the last one, citing threats. Who better to handle such a nuclear allegation than Trump’s right-hand man, Michael Cohen?</p>

<p>During a live session on The Red Letter, I pressed Cohen about Trump’s connections to Epstein. After four minutes of vehement denials—“I have no knowledge of anything with Jeffrey Epstein. Zero!”—Cohen slipped up, admitting he had indeed handled a rape complaint linked to both Epstein and Trump. This wasn’t a leak from an anonymous source; this was a confession from the man himself. The implications are staggering, yet the mainstream media remains eerily silent.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I have no knowledge of anything with Jeffrey Epstein. Zero.” — Michael Cohen</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Why is it that such a critical admission is being swept under the rug? The Epstein case is a Pandora's box that could expose powerful figures across the political spectrum. The media's reluctance to engage with Cohen's revelations raises questions about complicity and fear in the face of a story that could potentially unravel the fabric of political alliances. It seems that only independent media outlets are willing to confront the uncomfortable truths that lie beneath the surface of this scandal.</p>

<p>In a world where sensationalism often overshadows the truth, it is imperative to sift through the noise and focus on the facts. Cohen's admission opens a door to a broader investigation into the connections between Epstein, Trump, and the many powerful players in their orbit. The implications of such relationships could be profound, and the survivors of Epstein’s heinous operations deserve to have their stories told. They have been denied justice for far too long, and it is time for the truth to emerge from the shadows.</p>

<p>The silence of the mainstream media is deafening. It begs the question: what are they afraid of? Are they protecting the powerful or simply avoiding the backlash that could come with tackling such a sensitive subject? The American public deserves answers, and it is the responsibility of journalists to pursue the truth, no matter how uncomfortable it may be.</p>

<p>As we continue to peel back the layers of this convoluted saga, let us not forget the stakes involved. The lives of survivors hang in the balance, and the truth about Epstein’s network of enablers must be uncovered. Michael Cohen's admission is just the tip of the iceberg, and it is time for the public to demand accountability from those who have the power to shine a light on these dark corners.</p>

<p>Stay tuned as we continue to follow this story closely. The truth is out there, and with each revelation, we move one step closer to justice for those who have been silenced for too long.</p>
