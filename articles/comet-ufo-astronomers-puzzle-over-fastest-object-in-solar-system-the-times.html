      <h2>Comet? UFO? Astronomers puzzle over fastest object in solar system</h2>

<p>A team of scientists in Massachusetts has discovered a new celestial object, named 3I/Atlas, which is currently travelling at 118,000 miles per hour, making it the fastest object recorded in our solar system. The announcement was made just after midnight on July 1, based on data from a telescope in Chile.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it has spurred debate among astronomers about the nature of the object. While some believe it to be a cosmic iceberg from another star system, others, including Harvard astronomer Avi Loeb, suggest it could be an alien probe. The object is also notable for being only the third interstellar object ever recorded passing through the solar system.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovery time: 1:15 AM local time, July 1</li>
    <li>Location: Massachusetts, data from telescope in the Atacama Desert, Chile</li>
    <li>Speed: 118,000 miles per hour</li>
    <li>Closest approach to the sun: October 29, 2023</li>
    <li>Size: Estimated between 200 and 5,000 metres</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar objects: Oumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 1, at 1:15 AM, the Minor Planet Center announced the sighting of 3I/Atlas. This announcement attracted astronomers worldwide, who began observing the object.</p>
<p>On July 2, Avi Loeb appeared on a late-night radio show and subsequently began posting essays about 3I/Atlas, which garnered significant attention online.</p>
<p>Loeb noted that the object has an unusual trajectory and lacks a trail of dust, raising questions about its nature and origin.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We at the Minor Planet Center have the role to collect the information and also to post it quickly, almost in real time, on our website if the object is somehow interesting,” said Peter Veres, a Harvard astronomer.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “There is no trail of dust,” said Avi Loeb. “The chance of it being on that plane is one in 500.”
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It’s interesting because of its shape and its odd motion,” said Peter Veres about the object, referencing its lack of a fuzzy halo typical of comets.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/Atlas is only the third interstellar object ever recorded, following Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Oumuamua's unusual shape and movement sparked speculation about its origins, while 2I/Borisov behaved more like a traditional comet. These prior sightings have set a precedent for ongoing investigations into the nature of interstellar objects.</p>
<p>As more interstellar objects are tracked, researchers hope to better understand what is ordinary for such comets and how they interact within our solar system.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Scientists will continue to observe 3I/Atlas as it approaches the sun. Its trajectory and behavior will be monitored closely, particularly as it is expected to increase speed to approximately 152,000 miles per hour. Future observations may provide more insight into its composition and origin.</p>
