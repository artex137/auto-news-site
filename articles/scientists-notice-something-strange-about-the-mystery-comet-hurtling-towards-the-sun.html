      <h2>Scientists notice ‘something strange’ about the mystery comet hurtling towards the sun</h2>

<p>Scientists have detected unusual features in interstellar comet 3I/Atlas, which is approaching the sun at a speed of 209,000 kilometres per hour. Researchers using the James Webb Space Telescope captured images of the comet, discovered in July 2025, as it prepares to pass the sun in October 2025.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because 3I/Atlas is only the third confirmed interstellar comet. Astronomers are eager to learn more about its composition and origin, as it may provide insights into the early solar system and the conditions present when it formed. The comet’s speed and trajectory suggest it has been travelling for billions of years, influenced by gravitational forces.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet name: 3I/Atlas</li>
    <li>Speed: 209,000 km/h</li>
    <li>Estimated size: 5.6 kilometres wide</li>
    <li>Discovered: July 2025</li>
    <li>Expected solar passage: October 2025</li>
    <li>Age: Approximately 3 billion years older than the solar system</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In July 2025, astronomers discovered comet 3I/Atlas using the James Webb Space Telescope. Since then, scientists have been conducting observations to analyze its composition and dynamics. The comet is expected to make its closest approach to the sun in October 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “Our observations are compatible with an intrinsically CO2-rich nucleus, which may indicate that 3I/Atlas contains ices exposed to higher levels of radiation than Solar System comets, or that it formed close to the CO2 ice line in its parent protoplanetary disk,” researchers stated.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of 3I/Atlas adds to the growing body of knowledge regarding interstellar objects. Previous interstellar comets, like 1I/2017 U1 (Oumuamua) and 2I/Borisov, have offered unique insights into materials from outside our solar system. Understanding these objects can help refine theories about the formation and evolution of planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I/Atlas as it approaches the sun. They aim to gather more data on its physical properties and composition during its passage, which may further illuminate the comet's origins and characteristics.</p>
