<h2>Twins Fans in Uproar as Pohlads Decide to Hold On Tight</h2>

<p>In a move that has left Minnesota Twins fans shaking their heads in disbelief, the Pohlad family has announced they will continue as the team's principal owners. This shocking declaration comes just days after a significant roster overhaul and a previous hint that a sale was on the horizon. Many fans are crying foul, and rightfully so, as frustration reaches a boiling point.</p>

<p>On August 13, 2025, CBS Minnesota reported that the Pohlads, who have owned the Twins since 1984, have opted to keep control despite "several months" of exploring potential partnerships that might lead to a sale. Instead of selling, they are bringing in two unnamed "partnership groups." The lack of transparency regarding these partnerships and their stakes in the team has only fueled the fire of discontent among fans.</p>

<blockquote>
    "I think another season under the Pohlads will just continue to bring the organization down," said David Walsh, a disgruntled fan from Edina.
</blockquote>

<p>Walsh’s sentiments echo the thoughts of many across the state. Austin Otier from Minneapolis expressed his frustration, stating, "I saw it on my phone and I just got so frustrated. Immediately texted my group chat, I said, 'You know what guys, this season's over, and the next five seasons probably.'" Clearly, the Pohlads' decision has left fans feeling hopeless about the team's future.</p>

<p>Local business owner Jimmy Lonetti, who runs D&J Glove Repair in Minneapolis, weighed in, calling the announcement "out of touch and tone deaf." He questioned the sincerity of the Pohlads' commitment to improving the team, stating, "How can they put out a press release like that with a straight face?" Indeed, the Pohlads claimed their ownership group is committed to building a winning culture for the region, but many fans remain skeptical, demanding proof of genuine effort.</p>

<blockquote>
    "It's going to be an interesting off season," Lonetti said. "They're going to really have to prove to the fans that they're sincere about making the Twins a competitive team again."
</blockquote>

<p>The backlash has not been limited to face-to-face conversations; social media is ablaze with furious comments. One fan lamented, "A letter no fan wanted to see," while another quipped, "At this point bananaball is more serious than the Pohlads are." The comments section has transformed into a battleground of discontent, with many fans demanding the Pohlads sell the team. "What kind of sick joke are the Pohlads playing! SELL THE TEAM!" exclaimed one outraged supporter.</p>

<p>Comparisons are being drawn to other infamous sports team owners. One fan labeled the Pohlads as "the Jerry Jones of baseball," referencing the controversial Dallas Cowboys owner known for his polarizing presence. Another fan, invoking a painful memory for Minnesota sports enthusiasts, remarked, "I haven't felt this hopeless since Blair Walsh missed the 27-yarder." It’s evident that the Pohlads’ decision has dredged up a long history of disappointment for fans of Minnesota sports.</p>

<blockquote>
    "The new team logo should be a wheelbarrow full of bricks since they are always rebuilding," another fan sarcastically suggested.
</blockquote>

<p>Despite the overwhelming negativity, some fans are still holding on to their loyalty, vowing to continue supporting the team. David Walsh stated, "I'll go to another game or two this season." Meanwhile, Otier added, "It's disappointing, but there's always a reason to come back. And it's just like the loyalty to your state and to the teams you've been rooting for." However, the question remains: how much longer can this loyalty endure when faced with such disheartening news?</p>

<p>As the off-season approaches, one thing is certain: the Pohlads have their work cut out for them. They must rally the fan base and prove that they are dedicated to transforming the Twins into a competitive team. Otherwise, they risk losing the very supporters who have stood by them through thick and thin.</p>

<p>The anger and disappointment surrounding this announcement have sparked conversations about alternatives. Lonetti suggested local amateur baseball leagues as a more appealing option for those disillusioned by the Twins’ management. "If fans are looking for a cheap alternative, go out to Gaylord or Glencoe or Hutchinson," he advised, hinting at the wealth of talent in local baseball that could provide a refreshing change from the Twins’ struggles.</p>

<p>As fans grapple with the Pohlads’ decision, the future of the Minnesota Twins hangs in the balance. Will the Pohlads rise to the occasion and prove their commitment to winning? Or will they continue to be the source of frustration for a fanbase desperate for change? Only time will tell, but one thing is clear: the Pohlads will have to do a lot more than just issue press releases to win back the hearts of Twins fans.</p>

<p>For the full statement from the Pohlad family, you can check the team’s official page. But be warned: you might want to brace yourself for more disappointment.</p>
