      <h2>Trump Privately Dismissed Epstein Victims as ‘Democrats’ - Rolling Stone</h2>

<p>In a shocking revelation that could rock the political landscape, reports have emerged suggesting that former President Donald Trump privately dismissed victims of Jeffrey Epstein’s horrific abuse as mere “Democrats.” This eyebrow-raising commentary comes amidst a growing uproar over the Trump administration's alleged mishandling of the Epstein investigation. As the scandal deepens, the Trump camp appears to be scrambling to control the narrative, but not without stirring the pot of outrage among Epstein's survivors and their families.</p>

<p>According to sources familiar with Trump's private remarks, the former president has been less than sympathetic to the victims speaking out against Epstein and his accomplice, Ghislaine Maxwell. Trump has reportedly critiqued these survivors, suggesting that their media appearances are part of an orchestrated effort to tarnish his reputation. “Some of them are clearly of a ‘Democrat’ political affiliation,” Trump allegedly mused, questioning whether they are colluding with leftist attorneys or groups to undermine him, as reported by Rolling Stone.</p>

<blockquote>“None of this is true,” a White House official retorted, dismissing the claims as “another desperate attempt by the failing Rolling Stone.”</blockquote>

<p>But the outcry from Epstein's victims is growing louder. Survivors and their families have been vocal about their dissatisfaction with the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein case, especially after the Justice Department announced in early July that it would not release the so-called Epstein files. This decision has only fueled the anger of those who have suffered at the hands of Epstein.</p>

<p>Adding fuel to the fire, Ghislaine Maxwell, who is currently serving a 20-year sentence for child sex trafficking, was recently transferred to a more lenient prison facility in Texas. This controversial move came after the Justice Department reportedly conferred with her in Florida, raising eyebrows and questions about the integrity of the judicial process. The Wall Street Journal revealed last month that Trump’s name appears in government evidence related to Epstein, although the details of this association remain murky.</p>

<p>Two sisters, Annie and Maria Farmer, who bravely testified against Maxwell during her trial, have taken their frustrations public. Annie Farmer recently told CNN, “This chaotic process that’s been unfolding has a real cost for survivors.” She lamented that victims were kept in the dark about critical decisions, such as Maxwell’s prison transfer, which they expected to learn about through official channels rather than sensationalized news reports.</p>

<blockquote>“A central part of trauma is a feeling of a lack of control, and that has certainly been triggered here,” Farmer stated.</blockquote>

<p>In a chilling commentary on the current political climate, Farmer added that the narrative being pushed by right-wing pundits—attempting to paint Maxwell as another victim—seems to be a ploy to soften public perception of her crimes. Trump has even hinted at the possibility of pardoning Maxwell, claiming he is “allowed” to do so, despite the overwhelming public sentiment that views her as a predator, not a victim.</p>

<p>Another survivor, Danielle Bensky, who accused Epstein of abuse in 2004, expressed her anguish over the Trump administration's approach, stating, “It feels like we’re being erased.” Bensky lamented, “All the brave women who came forward… all the work that we did to tell the world what happened to us, it’s all being erased.” This sentiment reflects a profound feeling of betrayal and abandonment among those who have suffered at the hands of Epstein and his associates.</p>

<p>The family of Virginia Giuffre, another victim of Epstein who tragically died by suicide earlier this year, also weighed in on Trump’s comments. In response to his assertion that Epstein had “stolen” Giuffre from Mar-a-Lago, where she had worked, the family released a statement condemning Trump’s remarks. “If our sister could speak today, she would be most angered by the fact that the government is listening to a known perjurer,” they declared, demanding accountability and transparency from the government.</p>

<blockquote>“We and the public are asking for answers; survivors deserve this,” the family emphasized.</blockquote>

<p>In a recent memo submitted to the U.S. District Court, one anonymous victim stated, “We deserve transparency from our own government, the agencies that were supposed to be there to protect us victims.” This stark reminder of the failures of the system adds another layer of complexity to an already convoluted saga.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), a frequent critic of Trump, has announced a press conference scheduled for September 3, with survivors of Epstein’s abuse and their attorneys. The question remains: will these families ever receive the audience they deserve with Trump or other top officials? As the former president continues to express his frustrations over the accusations, the public is left wondering how much longer the Trump administration can keep its head buried in the sand.</p>

<p>In a desperate bid to divert attention from the Epstein scandal, Trump has resorted to reviving unfounded conspiracy theories regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election, while simultaneously instructing the Justice Department to “go after” Barack Obama and other political adversaries. The walls are closing in, and as the scandal unfolds, one thing is certain: the victims of Jeffrey Epstein will not be silenced.</p>
