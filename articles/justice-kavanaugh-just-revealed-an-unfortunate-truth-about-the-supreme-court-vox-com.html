<h2>Justice Kavanaugh Just Revealed an Unfortunate Truth About the Supreme Court</h2>

<p>In a stunning display of judicial gymnastics, Justice Brett Kavanaugh has just laid bare an unsettling reality about the Supreme Court's handling of free speech cases. On Thursday, the Court issued a brief order that allows a controversial Mississippi law—aimed at restricting minors' access to social media—to remain in place, albeit temporarily. This law, part of the case known as <em>Netchoice v. Fitch</em>, raises alarm bells about the state of free speech in America and the Court's role in safeguarding it.</p>

<p>Kavanaugh, who occupies the ideological center of this conservative Court, issued a concurring opinion that has left many scratching their heads. He stated that the Mississippi law “would likely violate [social media companies’] First Amendment rights under this Court’s precedents.” Yet, he still sided with the majority decision, arguing that the plaintiff—a trade group representing internet companies—“has not sufficiently demonstrated that the balance of harms and equities favors it at this time.” Is this a case of political maneuvering, or is Kavanaugh genuinely concerned about free speech?</p>

<blockquote>“The balance of harms and equities” is a legal term that has been increasingly used in the Court's so-called “shadow docket” cases, which are expedited decisions made without full briefing or oral arguments.</blockquote>

<p>What’s particularly perplexing is Kavanaugh’s reference to the “balance of harms and equities.” This legal jargon refers to a rule established in <em>Nken v. Holder</em> (2009), which stipulates that a litigant must not only show they are likely to win on appeal but also prove they will suffer “irreparable injury” if a stay is not granted. Yet, in this case, it appears no child has been irreparably harmed by the Mississippi law, which seems more like a toothless tiger than a roaring beast ready to protect minors. After all, how many children have been denied access to social media due to parental consent requirements?</p>

<p>Kavanaugh’s decision to lean on <em>Nken</em> in this instance is particularly curious. As Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson pointed out in her dissenting opinions earlier this year, when the Trump administration sought shadow docket relief, the Court often turned a blind eye to the <em>Nken</em> standard. For example, in <em>Social Security Administration v. AFSCME</em> (2025), the Republican justices ruled in favor of the Trump administration, granting immediate access to sensitive information without demonstrating any actual harm. Trump's lawyers could not even articulate a clear injury, instead resorting to vague assertions about the President’s authority.</p>

<blockquote>“The lower court order blocking DOGE’s access impinges on the President’s broad authority,” claimed Trump's legal team, with no substantiated evidence of harm.</blockquote>

<p>Kavanaugh's opinion in <em>Fitch</em> is revealing for two significant reasons. First, it comes on the heels of a Supreme Court decision last June that slightly rolled back First Amendment protections, allowing states to require pornographic websites to verify users' ages. Following that ruling, there was widespread speculation about whether the Supreme Court intended to further erode First Amendment rights. Kavanaugh’s recent concurrence suggests that, at least for now, the First Amendment is not entirely under siege.</p>

<p>To his credit, Kavanaugh has historically leaned towards protecting free speech, even when faced with Republican lawmakers eager to impose restrictions. However, his dual approach raises questions: Is Kavanaugh a protector of free speech, or is he merely playing a game of legal chess, where only the powerful, like Donald Trump, get special treatment?</p>

<p>Indeed, the stark contrast between how the Court handles cases involving Trump and those involving other litigants is alarming. It appears that only Trump enjoys a unique exemption from the rigorous standards that apply to the average citizen or organization seeking justice. This begs the question: Are we witnessing a Supreme Court that prioritizes political interests over fundamental rights?</p>

<blockquote>“For most litigants, Nken remains good law. Only Donald Trump appears to enjoy the special exemption,” stated legal analysts.</blockquote>

<p>As the landscape of free speech in America continues to evolve, the implications of Kavanaugh's recent opinion cannot be overstated. The Mississippi law, while ostensibly designed to protect children, may in fact serve as a vehicle for broader societal control over speech and expression on the internet. With Kavanaugh's words echoing in the halls of power, the question remains: How far will the Supreme Court go to uphold the First Amendment, and who will ultimately benefit from its protections?</p>

<p>In this age of heightened political tension and scrutiny of the judicial system, one thing is clear: the Supreme Court's decisions will have lasting repercussions on the very fabric of free speech in our society. Will the Court rise to the occasion and defend our rights, or will it continue to play favorites, leaving the average citizen to fend for themselves in a murky legal landscape?</p>
