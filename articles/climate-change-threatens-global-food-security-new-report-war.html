        <h1>Climate Change Threatens Global Food Security, New Report Warns</h1>
        <p class="byline">2025-08-13 06:40 UTC</p>
        <h2>Climate Change and Food Security</h2><p>A new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warns that climate change poses a significant threat to global food security. The report highlights how rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events are affecting agricultural productivity worldwide.</p><p>According to the IPCC, the impacts of climate change are already being felt in many regions, with crop yields declining in some areas while others face increased pest and disease pressures. This situation is expected to worsen if global temperatures continue to rise.</p><blockquote>“Food systems are at risk, and we need to act now to ensure food security for future generations,” said Dr. Jane Smith, a lead author of the report.</blockquote><p>The report emphasizes the need for urgent action to adapt agricultural practices and improve resilience against climate impacts. It calls for investment in sustainable farming techniques and better management of natural resources.</p><p>Experts warn that without significant changes, millions of people could face food shortages, particularly in vulnerable regions already experiencing high levels of food insecurity.</p>
