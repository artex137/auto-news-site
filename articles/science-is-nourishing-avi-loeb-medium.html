      <h2>Comet 3I/ATLAS Sparks Scientific Curiosity</h2>
<p>Harvard University astrophysicist Avi Loeb has discussed the significance of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which is expected to approach the Sun on October 29, 2025. His remarks highlight the potential for new discoveries about the object, which may be either a comet or an artificial spacecraft. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this event.</p>
<p>Loeb, who leads the Galileo Project, emphasizes that the approach of 3I/ATLAS could provide valuable insights into its nature and the broader universe. He encourages scientists and the public to observe the object closely, as it could inspire a new generation of scientists.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Expected perihelion: October 29, 2025</li>
    <li>Diameter of 3I/ATLAS: approximately 20 kilometers</li>
    <li>Significance: Potentially provides insights into interstellar objects and extraterrestrial technology</li>
    <li>Lead researcher: Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been identified as an interstellar object approaching the Solar System. As it nears the Sun, scientists expect its outgassing to increase, shedding ice and potentially revealing more about its composition. The object is slated to reach perihelion on October 29, 2025.</p>
<p>Loeb has requested that the Galileo Project research team monitor any increase in unidentified anomalous phenomena as the object approaches its closest point to the Sun.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“We should not ignore the possibility that 3I/ATLAS is alien technology. It is prudent to imagine this possibility and encourage observers to collect as much data as possible in an attempt to prove it wrong,” said Loeb.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The interest in 3I/ATLAS follows previous discussions about the potential for extraterrestrial life and the importance of scientific inquiry. Loeb argues that current scientific frameworks can sometimes stifle bold exploration, which is essential for progress. His previous works have sparked debate about the nature of interstellar objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The Galileo Project will continue to monitor 3I/ATLAS as it approaches the Sun. Researchers aim to gather data that could clarify the object's origins and characteristics, fostering further scientific inquiry and public interest in astronomy.</p>
