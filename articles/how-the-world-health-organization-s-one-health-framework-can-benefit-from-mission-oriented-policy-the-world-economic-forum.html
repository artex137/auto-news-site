<h2>How the World Health Organization’s ‘One Health’ Framework Can Benefit From Mission-Oriented Policy</h2>

<p>In an era teetering on the brink of health and environmental collapse, the World Health Organization's (WHO) ‘One Health’ framework stands as a beacon of hope—or is it? This integrative model, which recognizes the interdependence of human, animal, and environmental health, is being hailed by some as the solution to our global crises. However, a closer examination reveals a troubling reality: slow, fragmented policy delivery that could render this ambitious initiative utterly ineffective.</p>

<p>Enter economist and academic Mariana Mazzucato, whose mission-oriented policymaking offers a potential lifeline. Mazzucato’s approach could unify the disparate domains of health, agriculture, and ecology under a single Grand Challenge, paving the way for coordinated efforts such as integrated zoonotic early-warning systems and regenerative agricultural practices. But will it be enough to overcome the inertia plaguing the WHO and its One Health framework?</p>

<p>The Global Health and Strategic Outlook 2023 paints a dire picture: an estimated shortage of 10 million healthcare workers worldwide by 2030. While the World Economic Forum (WEF) claims to be working with governments and businesses to build resilient and equitable healthcare systems, one has to wonder if these efforts are merely smoke and mirrors. After all, the WHO’s One Health framework has already been criticized for its slow and fragmented policy delivery.</p>

<blockquote>“Preventing pandemics requires a shift in how we manage land, biodiversity, and animals,” the source claims, highlighting the urgent need for a cohesive strategy. But what are the chances of that happening?</blockquote>

<p>Let’s not forget the staggering statistics: zoonoses, diseases transmitted from animals to humans, cause approximately 2.5 billion cases of illness and 2.7 million deaths annually. Incredibly, 75% of emerging infectious diseases are of animal origin. If that doesn’t scream for a unified response, what does? Yet, even with this knowledge, key policy actors remain ensconced in their silos, failing to act with the urgency demanded by the situation.</p>

<p>The WHO's current strategy appears to be little more than a collection of incoherent and disjointed policies, lacking the institutional mechanisms necessary to mobilize collective ambition. Mazzucato’s mission-oriented approach could serve as a vital framework, allowing policymakers to structure public policy around ‘grand challenges’ that unify multiple sectors. But will they take the leap?</p>

<p>Imagine a Grand Challenge focused on “preventing and mitigating zoonotic pandemics and ecosystem-driven health crises in an age of climate, biodiversity, and food system breakdown.” This could serve as a central hub for coordinated policy development and delivery. But can we trust the WHO to rise to this occasion?</p>

<blockquote>“More than a theoretical framework, it is a call to structure public policy around ‘grand challenges’,” the source states. But given the WHO's track record, skepticism is warranted.</blockquote>

<p>Some might argue that the WHO’s efforts are commendable, citing achievements like the delivery of over 1 billion COVID-19 vaccines through COVAX and the saving of more than 13 million lives thanks to the Gavi Vaccine Alliance. However, these successes feel like a mere drop in the bucket compared to the overwhelming challenges that lie ahead. The WHO's failure to deliver timely, coherent policies under the One Health framework is a glaring oversight that could cost lives.</p>

<p>Moreover, the WHO is not operating in a vacuum. The Global Coalition for Value in Healthcare, the Davos Alzheimer’s Collaborative, and other initiatives are all part of a complex web of entities trying to tackle these issues. Yet, without a unified approach, these efforts risk becoming just another collection of isolated projects rather than a cohesive strategy.</p>

<p>So, what does the future hold? Mazzucato’s mission-oriented policymaking could be the key to bridging the gaps between these sectors. By establishing specific and time-bound missions—such as developing integrated early-warning systems for zoonotic spillover by 2030 or transitioning 30% of high-risk agricultural systems to ecologically regenerative models by 2035—the WHO could finally gain the momentum it so desperately needs.</p>

<blockquote>“This cross-sectoral approach not only amplifies impact but also builds resilience into the political and institutional systems,” the source emphasizes. But can we trust that these lofty ideals will translate into actionable results?</blockquote>

<p>In conclusion, the WHO's One Health framework is at a crossroads. With a mission-oriented approach spearheaded by Mazzucato, there’s a glimmer of hope that we might finally see the integration of policies that address the interconnected crises we face. However, the skepticism surrounding the WHO's ability to deliver on this promise remains palpable. As we navigate these turbulent waters, one thing is clear: without decisive action, the world could pay a heavy price for our failure to embrace a truly One Health approach.</p>
