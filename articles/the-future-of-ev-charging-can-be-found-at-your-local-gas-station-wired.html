<h2>The Future of EV Charging Can Be Found at Your Local Gas Station - WIRED</h2>

<p>In a shocking twist of fate that will leave electric vehicle (EV) enthusiasts scratching their heads, the U.S. Department of Transportation has unveiled a new set of guidelines that could see billions of taxpayer dollars funneled right back into the hands of gas station and truck stop operators. Yes, you heard that right! The future of “topping up” your electric car may soon resemble the very gas-station experience we thought we were leaving behind.</p>

<p>This week, the DOT released interim guidance for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, which is set to control a whopping $5 billion earmarked for fast chargers across the United States. The goal? To establish a nationwide network of half a million public chargers, effectively eliminating the fear of running out of juice while on the road. But here's where things get murky. This program was initially introduced in 2021 as part of the Biden administration’s infrastructure bill, aimed at addressing one of the biggest deterrents for potential EV buyers—range anxiety. But hold your horses! This initiative faced a significant setback during the early days of Donald Trump's administration, when it was labeled an “electric vehicle mandate” and subsequently paused for what felt like an eternity.</p>

<blockquote>“The guidance only restates requirements already in law, making clear that the real purpose of the Trump administration’s freeze was to try to stall electric vehicle momentum,” said Katherine García, Sierra Club clean transportation head.</blockquote>

<p>Fast forward to now, and the DOT's new guidance is barely a departure from the previous set of rules. The Federal Highway Administration, the agency overseeing this initiative, claims its aim is to “streamline” the program. But for whom? The answer seems clear: it’s great news for the incumbents in the fossil fuel industry. The new provisions encourage states to award funding to charging locations where the business owners also own the land. And who stands to benefit from this? You guessed it—big names like Pilot Flying K, Love’s Travel Stops, and TravelCenters of America are likely to cash in on this bonanza.</p>

<p>But don’t be fooled into thinking this is a win for the average EV driver. The current recommendations from the federal government are merely “encouragements.” If states comply and send billions in public charger money to these gas station empires, we could find ourselves charging our electric vehicles at the same old, amenity-rich locations where we once filled our gas tanks. Talk about a regression!</p>

<p>Loren McDonald, chief analyst at Paren, an EV charging data analytics firm, weighed in on this puzzling development. He noted that installing EV chargers is incredibly complex, involving permits, construction, and high costs for electrical equipment. McDonald stated, “With the feds’ new arrangement, you don’t have to go through a lease negotiation, which can take a long time—months.” So, while the feds streamline the process for their gas station buddies, what does this mean for smaller players in the EV charging space? Are they simply being pushed aside?</p>

<blockquote>“The refueling experience for electricity should be as similar as possible to today’s refueling experience and should work with consumer behaviors and habits,” said Tiffany Wlazlowski Neuman, spokesperson for the National Association of Truck Stop Owners.</blockquote>

<p>And let’s not overlook the fact that the new guidance has also rescinded previous language that encouraged states to consider the involvement of small businesses, particularly minority- and women-owned enterprises, in the charger installation process. This raises a red flag about the inclusivity of this initiative. Are we really moving towards a greener future, or are we merely reinforcing the status quo?</p>

<p>Environmental groups have been quick to criticize this new guidance, suggesting that it undermines the very principles of equity and accessibility that should be at the heart of a sustainable transportation future. As García pointed out, the absence of considerations for rural, underserved, and disadvantaged communities is nothing short of a betrayal to those who need it most.</p>

<p>As the landscape of EV charging evolves, it seems we are at a crossroads. Will we embrace a future that prioritizes innovation and inclusivity, or will we find ourselves tethered to the gas stations of yesteryear, charging our vehicles in the same places where we once fueled our fossil-fueled cars? The choice appears to be in the hands of state governments, but with billions at stake, the pressure to conform to federal guidance may be too great to resist.</p>

<p>In conclusion, while the government touts its efforts to create a robust network of EV chargers, the reality may be a retrograde step into the arms of the very industry we are trying to move away from. The future of EV charging, it seems, is destined to echo the past, leaving us to wonder: are we really moving forward, or merely spinning our wheels?</p>
