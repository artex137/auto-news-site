      <h2>Dark Comets or Alien Tech? - Avi Loeb</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb has raised questions about the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, suggesting it may not be a typical comet. Loeb, a prominent astrophysicist and head of the Galileo Project, made his remarks as 3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion on October 29, 2025. There have been no reported injuries or fatalities related to this object.</p>

<p>Loeb's comments matter because they challenge existing definitions of celestial objects and could have implications for the study of extraterrestrial life. As 3I/ATLAS nears the Sun, astronomers and researchers are closely monitoring its trajectory and characteristics.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS approaches perihelion on October 29, 2025.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb leads the Galileo Project, which is constructing three observatories across Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Nevada.</li>
    <li>The project aims to monitor the sky for Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP).</li>
    <li>Loeb has published works including “Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth” and “Interstellar.”</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On October 29, 2025, 3I/ATLAS is expected to reach perihelion, the point in its orbit closest to the Sun. Loeb has suggested that as this object approaches, its characteristics will provide clearer insights into its nature.</p>
<p>Previous studies of interstellar objects, such as 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also raised questions about their classifications. Loeb has pointed out that even well-known telescopes have struggled to identify certain objects accurately.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, “The fact that astronomers call something a comet, does not mean that it is a comet.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb added, “We aim to measure distances of outliers as UAP candidates, and analyze their properties with state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous interstellar objects have sparked debates regarding their origins and classifications. For instance, 1I/`Oumuamua exhibited non-gravitational acceleration but was classified as a dark comet despite a lack of evidence for cometary activity.</p>
<p>Loeb’s work with the Galileo Project aims to provide more comprehensive data on such objects, particularly as they approach Earth.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS gets closer to the Sun, the Galileo Project will continue its observations. Researchers will analyze the properties of the object to determine whether it is an interstellar comet or possibly a technological probe.</p>
