      <h2>MAGA lawmaker Anna Paulina Luna claims Congress has seen proof of ‘interdimensional beings’</h2>

<p>Florida Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna has stated that Congress has seen evidence of “interdimensional beings” during an episode of the Joe Rogan Experience podcast on Wednesday. Luna claims this information stems from credible testimonies and photographic evidence, though specifics about the evidence have not been disclosed.</p>

<p>This statement highlights ongoing discussions in Congress regarding unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs). Luna, along with Kentucky Rep. James Comer, has requested a briefing from various government officials about UAP records, aiming for greater transparency on the issue.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Rep. Anna Paulina Luna has claimed to have seen evidence of “interdimensional beings.”</li>
    <li>Luna made the statements during a podcast episode on Wednesday, date not disclosed.</li>
    <li>She has expressed confidence in the existence of entities not created by mankind.</li>
    <li>Letters were sent in February to Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, and CIA Director John Ratcliffe.</li>
    <li>Luna leads a task force focused on the declassification of federal secrets related to UAPs.</li>
    <li>Congress has held multiple hearings on UAPs in recent years, including a joint hearing in November of last year.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In February, Anna Paulina Luna and James Comer sent letters to key government officials requesting a briefing on UAP records. On Wednesday, during a podcast with Joe Rogan, Luna discussed her confidence in the existence of non-human entities based on testimonies and evidence she claims to have seen.</p>

<p>Congress has been addressing UAP issues, with hearings and investigations aimed at promoting transparency. A notable joint hearing occurred in November 2022, focusing on the truth behind UAPs.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Based on testimony that would be based on witnesses that have come forward... they’ve seen things,” Luna said. “There have been incidences that I believe were very credible people have reported that there have been movements outside of time and space.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>“When you have thousands upon thousands of people throughout time that have reported something... that in itself is a disinformation campaign to get people to shut up about it,” Luna stated.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>In recent years, Congress has increased its focus on UAPs, pushing for more transparency and improved reporting systems. The Pentagon reported in March 2024 that no evidence of extraterrestrial spacecraft was found, despite ongoing congressional interest in the topic.</p>

<p>Former military officials have testified that they believe the government possesses more information about UAPs than it is willing to disclose. This has fueled public and governmental interest in the subject.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress is expected to continue its investigations into UAPs, with potential future hearings and requests for information from the intelligence community. The timeline for any new disclosures or findings remains unclear.</p>
