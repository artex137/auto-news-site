<h2>MAGA Lawmaker Anna Paulina Luna Claims Congress Has Seen Proof of ‘Interdimensional Beings’</h2>

<p>In a shocking revelation that could only be described as sensational, Florida Republican Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna has taken the U.S. Congress by storm, claiming to have seen evidence of “interdimensional beings.” Yes, you heard that right! During a recent episode of the Joe Rogan Experience, Luna asserted that she has been privy to information suggesting that these beings can operate through “the time spaces that we currently have.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I think that they can actually operate through the time spaces that we currently have,” Luna told Rogan, clearly unfazed by the incredulous nature of her claims.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This jaw-dropping statement comes amid a broader national conversation about unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAP), a topic that has garnered significant attention from Congress in recent years. Luna, a rising star in the MAGA movement endorsed by none other than Donald Trump, is not just throwing around wild theories; she’s actively pursuing investigations into these alleged phenomena.</p>

<p>In February, Luna and fellow Republican Representative James Comer sent letters to key government officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, demanding a comprehensive briefing on all records related to UAPs. Her quest for truth is relentless, as she claims to have uncovered new information that challenges the very fabric of our understanding of reality.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Based on testimony that would be based on witnesses that have come forward… they’ve seen things,” Luna stated, suggesting that credible individuals have reported encounters with these mysterious entities. “There have been incidences that I believe were very credible.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But hold on—what exactly does this mean? Luna has not directly witnessed a spaceship or a “portal,” but insists she’s on a quest for more evidence, claiming that “based on the photos that I’ve seen, I’m very confident that there’s things out there that have not been created by mankind.” The implications of such a statement are staggering. Are we to believe that alien technology is already among us, hidden away from public scrutiny?</p>

<p>As if this wasn’t enough to raise eyebrows, Luna, who has a background as an airfield manager with the Portland International Guard, asserts that she has interacted with F-15 pilots who have had close encounters with UAPs. “There’s definitely something that I can tell you with confidence, that we don’t know how to explain currently,” she proclaimed with unyielding certainty. Who needs scientific proof when you have a congresswoman’s word?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We know the U.S. government has not exactly been clean in a lot of what they’ve done with the American people, specifically to the topic of UFOs,” Luna stated, accusing the intelligence community of withholding critical information. “When you have thousands upon thousands of people throughout time that have reported something, to say that those people are crazy… that in itself is a disinformation campaign.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is this the dawn of a new era of transparency, or merely a smokescreen to distract from more pressing issues? Congress has indeed addressed UAPs in recent years, with multiple hearings and investigations aimed at shedding light on the subject. Just last November, the House Oversight Committee held a joint hearing titled “Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena: Exposing the Truth.” However, a Pentagon report released in March 2024 concluded that there was no evidence of extraterrestrial spacecraft, a direct contradiction to Luna’s assertions.</p>

<p>Moreover, a July 2023 House Oversight subcommittee hearing featured testimonies from former military officials who claimed the government knows far more about UAPs than it is letting on. Are we witnessing a battle between those seeking the truth and those determined to keep it hidden? It certainly seems so.</p>

<p>Luna’s comments raise more questions than answers. Are we to trust a congresswoman who is seemingly convinced of interdimensional beings while the Pentagon insists there’s nothing to see here? The narrative is muddied further by Luna’s insistence that the intelligence community is engaged in a “protective complex,” fearing that Americans may not be able to handle the “realities” of these findings.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There is a protective complex from authorities who think that Americans might not be able to handle the realities of what has been found,” she argued, as if her own understanding of interdimensional beings qualifies her to speak for the entire nation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As Congress continues to grapple with the topic of UAPs, one thing is clear: Anna Paulina Luna is not backing down. Whether she’s a visionary on the frontier of truth or just another voice in a chorus of conspiracy theories remains to be seen. But one thing is certain—this saga is far from over, and we’ll be watching closely as more revelations unfold from the halls of Congress and beyond.</p>
