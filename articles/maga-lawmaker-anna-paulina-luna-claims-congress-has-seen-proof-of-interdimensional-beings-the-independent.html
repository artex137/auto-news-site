      <h2>MAGA lawmaker Anna Paulina Luna claims Congress has seen proof of ‘interdimensional beings’</h2>

<p>Florida Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna has claimed that Congress has seen evidence of “interdimensional beings” during an appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast on Wednesday. Luna has stated that these entities can operate through "time spaces" and asserted that her claims are based on information provided to her and on testimonies from credible witnesses.</p>

<p>This assertion has reignited discussions on unidentified anomalous phenomena (UAPs) and has prompted calls for transparency from U.S. authorities. Luna, who is a member of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, has been actively involved in pushing for the declassification of information related to UAPs.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna made her claims on October 25, 2023.</li>
    <li>She is a rising star in the MAGA movement and has been endorsed by former President Donald Trump.</li>
    <li>Luna has sent letters to key officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, requesting briefings on UAP records.</li>
    <li>She has stated that during her time as an airfield manager, she spoke with F-15 pilots who reported UAP encounters.</li>
    <li>Congress has held multiple hearings on UAPs, including a joint hearing by the House Oversight Committee in November 2022.</li>
    <li>The Pentagon issued a report in March 2024 that found no evidence of extraterrestrial spacecraft.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>In February 2023, Anna Paulina Luna and Rep. James Comer sent letters to government officials requesting information on UAPs. On October 25, 2023, Luna appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience, where she claimed Congress has seen evidence of interdimensional beings and discussed the potential cover-up of UAP sightings. In November 2022, Congress held a joint hearing on UAPs, and in March 2024, the Pentagon reported finding no evidence of extraterrestrial spacecraft.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Based on testimony that would be based on witnesses that have come forward... there have been incidences that I believe were very credible,” Luna stated on the podcast.</blockquote>
<blockquote>“We know the U.S. government has not exactly been clean in a lot of what they’ve done with the American people, specifically to the topic of UFOs,” she added.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The issue of UAPs has gained traction in recent years, with various congressional hearings aimed at increasing transparency and establishing a safe reporting system for individuals who encounter such phenomena. Lawmakers have expressed concerns over the intelligence community's handling of information related to UAPs.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Congress is expected to continue its investigations into UAPs, and Luna's task force will work on declassifying federal secrets related to these phenomena.</p>
