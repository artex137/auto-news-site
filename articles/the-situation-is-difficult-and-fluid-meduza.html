      <h2>‘The situation is difficult and fluid’ - Meduza</h2>

<p>In a shocking turn of events that has left military analysts scrambling, the Ukrainian OSINT project known as DeepState has reported that Russian forces have allegedly broken through defensive lines near the city of Dobropillia, situated in the volatile eastern Donetsk region of Ukraine. This audacious advance appears to be aimed at two key cities: Kramatorsk and Sloviansk. But hold your horses—before we jump to conclusions, it’s crucial to note that independent analysts are cautioning against accepting these claims at face value. No visual confirmation has emerged yet, and if these reports are indeed accurate, we may be witnessing one of Russia’s most significant military advances in months.</p>

<p>In a report dated August 11, DeepState indicated that Russian troops had pushed eight to ten kilometers (five to six miles) north of Pokrovsk, reaching critical villages such as Kucheriv Yar and Zolotyi Kolodyaz. This strategic positioning has set the stage for further assaults, with Russian forces reportedly amassing troops for their next move. By August 20, DeepState noted that around 20 Russian soldiers were stationed in Vesele, a village they had recently targeted.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Ukrainian commanders either do not grasp the full depth of the problem or are presenting the situation as ‘under control,’” the OSINT group stated ominously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Meanwhile, the Russian army is allegedly attempting to secure positions along the Dobropillia–Kramatorsk highway, gathering around the villages of Novovodyane and Petrivka. The report paints a grim picture: Russian troops are “probing for weak spots to advance further” while quickly entrenching themselves for a sustained offensive. Notably, DeepState warned that the capture of Zolotyi Kolodyaz and its neighboring villages could lead to a rapid fall of Dobropillia, potentially outpacing the fall of Pokrovsk itself.</p>

<p>Pasi Paroinen, a military analyst from the Black Bird Group based in Finland, echoed these concerns. On August 12, he stated that the situation north of Pokrovsk was “deteriorating rapidly.” According to his analysis, Russian forces pushed approximately 17 kilometers (10 miles) past Ukrainian defensive lines between August 9 and 11. He reported that Russian units had reached the Dobropillia–Kramatorsk road, with infiltration groups spotted near Dobropillia proper.</p>

<p>Even more alarming, Ukrainska Pravda reported in late July that Russian forces had advanced more than 10 kilometers (about six miles) along the Pokrovsk–Kostiantynivka highway since May, creating an encirclement threat for the Pokrovsk–Myrnohrad agglomeration. The publication noted that this expansion effectively meant the loss of Pokrovsk’s main supply line, which had already been closed to civilians due to Russian drone strikes in June.</p>

<p>Ukraine’s “Dnipro” operational strategic group, despite suffering losses, reported that Russian forces are exploiting their numerical superiority, attempting to infiltrate Ukrainian positions in small groups. However, they emphasized that Russian troops do not fully control the contested territory. “The fiercest fighting anywhere on the front is taking place near Dobropillia and Pokrovsk,” they noted, asserting that Ukrainian troops are “destroying” Russian units.</p>

<p>On August 12, Ukraine’s General Staff issued a statement asserting that their forces are taking “effective measures” to halt the Russian advance in the Dobropillia and Pokrovsk sectors. They revealed that over 110,000 Russian personnel have been concentrated in the Pokrovsk sector alone. “The situation is difficult and fluid, but the Defense Forces are taking all necessary measures to identify and destroy hostile groups,” the statement concluded, while also noting that reinforcements have been dispatched to the area.</p>

<p>In a harrowing development, fighters from the Azov Brigade recently took over a section of the defensive line on the Pokrovsk front. This area was previously under the control of the Ukrainian Armed Forces’ “Pokrovsk” tactical group, which has been criticized for failing to defend this crucial part of the front effectively. Bohdan Krotevych, Azov’s former chief of staff, did not mince words in his appeal to President Volodymyr Zelensky, describing the Pokrovsk–Kostiantynivka line as “an absolute clusterfuck.” He claimed that Pokrovsk and Myrnohrad are nearly encircled, while Kostiantynivka is “half-encircled,” with Russian forces pushing toward Kramatorsk and Druzhkivka.</p>

<p>Taras Chmut, head of the charity Come Back Alive, issued a stark warning: the situation in Donetsk could enable Russian armored groups to penetrate deep into Ukrainian territory. “And the map will start to ‘shift’ again, as it did in 2022 — by dozens, hundreds of square kilometers a day,” he cautioned.</p>

<p>However, amid the chaos, some voices are attempting to temper the panic. A user on X, identifying as Tatarigami_UA and claiming to be a Ukrainian reserve officer, argued that the situation, while serious, is “far from the collapse some suggest.” He pointed out that major offensives by Russia in 2014 and 2015 were strategically timed ahead of negotiations to gain leverage.</p>

<p>As the fog of war thickens, Russian pro-war Telegram channels have claimed that sabotage and reconnaissance groups have infiltrated the area surrounding Dobropillia. “Our forward units are indeed advancing in that direction, but it’s still difficult to judge the real scale or the forces the Russian army has committed to the push,” stated the channel Two Majors.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Rybar channel, with connections to Russia’s Defense Ministry, cautioned against jumping to conclusions about Russian securement of positions near Dobropillia. “Until we see imagery from objective control systems, it’s hard to talk about a full-scale breakthrough,” they noted.</p>

<p>Sergey Markov, a pro-Kremlin political analyst, boldly declared that the Russian advance represents “a partial collapse of the Ukrainian front due to a shortage of troops.” He suggested that this development is a “gift to Putin and Trump ahead of negotiations,” implying that Zelensky and Europe may have no choice but to concede territory in Donbas to avoid further military escalation.</p>

<p>As the situation unfolds, one thing remains clear: the battle for Dobropillia is emblematic of the broader struggle embroiling Ukraine and Russia, with stakes higher than ever. The world watches with bated breath, but the fog of war shrouds the truth, leaving us to wonder what the next chapter will hold.</p>
