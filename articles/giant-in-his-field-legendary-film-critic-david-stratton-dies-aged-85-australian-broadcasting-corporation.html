      <h2>'Giant in his field': Legendary film critic David Stratton dies aged 85</h2>

<p>In a shocking turn of events, the Australian film community mourns the loss of the indomitable David Stratton, who passed away at the age of 85. His family announced his death on Thursday afternoon, confirming he died peacefully in a hospital near his Blue Mountains home. The suddenness of this announcement has sent ripples of grief across the nation, as tributes pour in from all corners of the country.</p>

<blockquote>"David's passion for film, commitment to Australian cinema, and generous spirit touched countless lives,"</blockquote> the family stated, underscoring the profound impact he had on both the industry and audiences alike. This is not just the death of a critic; it’s the end of an era for Australian cinema, which Stratton championed for decades.

<p>Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was among the first to express his condolences, remarking, <blockquote>"All of us who tuned in to At the Movies respected him for his deep knowledge and for the gentle and generous way he passed it on."</blockquote> It’s a testament to Stratton’s legacy that even the highest office in the land recognizes his contribution to the cultural fabric of Australia.</p>

<p>Opposition Leader Sussan Ley echoed these sentiments, asserting that Stratton <blockquote>"encouraged us to value and celebrate our own creative voices."</blockquote> The outpouring of admiration has been overwhelming, with actress Rachel Griffiths calling him a <blockquote>"giant in his field — the biggest champion of Australian stories."</blockquote> The accolades are pouring in, and rightly so; Stratton was not merely a film critic, but a cultural institution.</p>

<p>Born in England in 1939, Stratton's early years were marked by a significant upheaval. While his father fought in World War II, young David was sent to live with his grandmother, where he first fell in love with cinema. His father, however, viewed movies as a waste of time, famously questioning, <blockquote>"Why on Earth do you want to go and see a film?"</blockquote> This familial conflict only deepened Stratton's resolve to pursue his passion.</p>

<p>In 1963, the young visionary migrated to Australia as a "ten-pound Pom," a term coined during the Chifley government's "populate or perish" scheme. Initially, his relocation was temporary, but it soon became clear that the allure of Australian cinema had captured his heart, much to his father's chagrin. Just three years later, in 1966, he became the director of the Sydney Film Festival, a role that would catapult him into the limelight and ultimately put Australian cinema on the global stage.</p>

<p>However, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. Stratton’s tenure at the Sydney Film Festival was riddled with controversy, as he was under surveillance by ASIO due to the festival's policy of showcasing films from the USSR and other nations not on friendly terms with Australia. This raises eyebrows about the intersection of art and politics during a time when censorship was rampant. Stratton was a fierce advocate against such suppression, which makes his contributions even more remarkable.</p>

<p>From 1984 to 2004, Stratton co-hosted The Movie Show alongside Margaret Pomeranz on SBS, delighting audiences with their dynamic chemistry and engaging reviews. Their disagreements became legendary, with viewers often aligning themselves as either a "David person" or a "Margaret person." This isn’t just nostalgia; it’s a reflection of how deeply Stratton and Pomeranz resonated with the public.</p>

<p>Yet, not everyone was enamored with Stratton’s candid approach. In 1992, after delivering a scathing review of Geoffrey Wright's neo-Nazi drama Romper Stomper, the director confronted him at the Venice Film Festival, throwing a glass of wine at him in a fit of rage. Stratton, unflinching, remarked, <blockquote>"A critic has to call it as they see it."</blockquote> This incident encapsulates the boldness with which he approached his craft.</p>

<p>In 2004, Stratton and Pomeranz transitioned to the ABC, where they hosted At the Movies for a decade, further cementing their place in Australian film culture. Despite their success, Stratton eventually expressed a desire to step back, noting, <blockquote>"I was getting a bit jaded."</blockquote> It’s a poignant reminder that even the giants of the industry feel the weight of their responsibilities.</p>

<p>A Member of the Order of Australia since 2015, Stratton's accolades are numerous, but his true legacy lies in his unwavering commitment to championing Australian cinema. As his family prepares for a public memorial service, one thing is clear: the film industry has lost not just a critic, but a true champion of creativity and storytelling.</p>

<p>As we reflect on his life and contributions, let us not forget the importance of voices like Stratton's in the fight against financial censorship and the suppression of artistic expression. In an era where the arts face unprecedented challenges, his legacy serves as a powerful reminder of the need for advocates who will stand up for creativity, integrity, and truth.</p>
