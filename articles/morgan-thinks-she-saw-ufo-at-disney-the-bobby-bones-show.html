      <h2>Witness Claims UFO Sighting at Disney's EPCOT</h2>

<p>Morgan has reported seeing a UFO while at Disney's EPCOT on Saturday evening. She and her boyfriend spotted a bright light in the sky while waiting for the fireworks show to begin.</p>

<p>This sighting has generated interest among UFO enthusiasts and prompted discussions about unidentified aerial phenomena. Authorities have not confirmed any investigations into the sighting, and no injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred on Saturday evening at EPCOT, Disney World.</li>
    <li>Morgan and her boyfriend noticed a bright light that was stationary for several minutes.</li>
    <li>Other patrons on the patio also observed the light, leading to a commotion.</li>
    <li>Morgan filmed the light but did not capture its disappearance.</li>
    <li>Disney has stated that it does not use drones for fireworks shows at EPCOT.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Morgan and her boyfriend arrived at EPCOT and took a seat on a patio to await the fireworks show. During this time, they noticed a bright light in the sky that appeared suddenly and remained stationary for several minutes. After the light vanished, Morgan recorded her experience but did not capture the moment of its disappearance.</p>

<p>Following the sighting, Morgan researched the possibility of the light being a drone but found that Disney does not employ drones during the fireworks. She dismissed the idea of it being a satellite due to its lack of movement.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“I thought it was definitely a UFO with aliens,” Morgan stated. “But the guys laughed at me, saying it wasn’t aliens.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Unidentified flying objects, or UFOs, have been a topic of fascination for many. Recent years have seen a resurgence in interest, particularly with the release of government reports on unidentified aerial phenomena. However, claims of UFO sightings often lack definitive evidence, leading to skepticism among the public.</p>

<p>Disney parks are known for their elaborate fireworks displays, which typically do not involve drones. This policy has been in place to ensure safety and maintain the experience of the shows.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>No official investigation into the sighting has been announced, and it remains unclear if any further inquiries will take place regarding the incident at EPCOT.</p>
