<h2>PHX PD Chief Matt Giordano lays out priorities for new job</h2>

<p>In a bold proclamation that echoes through the sun-soaked streets of Phoenix, Police Chief Matt Giordano has unveiled his ambitious agenda for the Phoenix Police Department. Could this be the turning point that the beleaguered city has been waiting for? Or just another set of lofty promises destined to fade into the desert air? As he took to the podium during a press conference on August 13, 2025, Giordano made it clear that he intends to prioritize building trust within the community, providing unwavering support to his officers, and ensuring a high level of service to the residents of Phoenix.</p>

<blockquote>“I have very simple priorities,” Giordano stated, as if simplicity could mask the complexities of policing in a city rife with challenges.</blockquote>

<p>With a police force currently standing at 2,600 officers, Giordano has set his sights on a lofty goal of recruiting up to 3,000 officers. But is this just a numbers game? Can the city afford to ramp up its police presence, or will this be yet another overreach? The new chief has reassured the public that he is taking the health and well-being of his officers seriously, asserting, “Hurt people hurt people and it’s cumulative.” This statement raises eyebrows—does it suggest that the very officers tasked with protecting the community are themselves grappling with unresolved trauma?</p>

<p>Giordano’s commitment to officer support appears robust, with a plan to monitor their mental health throughout their careers. But can a department that has faced criticism for its handling of sensitive issues truly turn the tide? As he aims to bolster recruitment, the new chief is also introducing an artificial intelligence program to handle nonemergency calls. “I’m a big proponent of leveraging technology,” he declared. But is the community ready to embrace AI as a substitute for human interaction in times of crisis?</p>

<blockquote>“If we can leverage technology using AI, I’m all for it,” Giordano confidently proclaimed, while some skeptics might question the implications of such a shift.</blockquote>

<p>While Giordano’s vision seems to be rooted in compassion and community engagement, there are underlying tensions that threaten to derail his plans. The specter of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) looms large over Phoenix, particularly following a troubling incident where an ICE agent allegedly detained a child’s guardian as the child walked to school. With community trust already hanging by a thread, Giordano’s pledge to distance the Phoenix Police Department from immigration enforcement is a bold move. He stated, “The Phoenix Police Department enforces Arizona Revised Statutes and City Codes. That is our primary responsibility. We don’t enforce immigration laws. We don’t ask about immigration status.”</p>

<p>This is a significant departure from past practices, particularly in light of the controversial SB 1070 law, which was ruled unconstitutional in 2018. Giordano's assertion that he has witnessed the erosion of trust firsthand is a sobering reminder of the scars that still linger in the community. “I saw the distrust that created in the community. So, we’re not going back down that road again,” he insisted. But can words truly mend the fractures of the past?</p>

<blockquote>“We will enforce laws. We’ll hold people accountable. … but we are not going to engage and make any kind of enforcement decisions or take any enforcement action related to immigration enforcement,” Giordano vowed.</blockquote>

<p>As Giordano embarks on this new chapter, his commitment to engaging with the community through meetings and advisory boards may be the key to his success—or failure. “We need to go out and engage the community where they work, where they live, so we understand what they’re going through,” he emphasized. Will this outreach be enough to rebuild the trust that has been so deeply eroded?</p>

<p>Amidst the backdrop of rising crime rates and community unrest, Giordano’s priorities may hold the potential for genuine change—or they could simply become another page in the book of unfulfilled promises. As the Phoenix Police Department moves forward under his leadership, only time will tell if the community will embrace this new direction or remain skeptical of the sweeping changes proposed by its new chief.</p>

<p>As we stand at the crossroads of hope and skepticism, one thing is certain: the eyes of Phoenix are upon Chief Matt Giordano. Will he rise to the occasion, or will his tenure become yet another cautionary tale in the annals of law enforcement history?</p>
