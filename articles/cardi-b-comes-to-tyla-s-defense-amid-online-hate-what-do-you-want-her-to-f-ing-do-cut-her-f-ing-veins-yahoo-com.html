<h2>Cardi B Rages Against Online Trolls Defaming Tyla: 'What Do You Want Her to F—ing Do?' </h2>

<p>In a jaw-dropping display of celebrity solidarity, Cardi B has come out swinging for South African pop star Tyla, who has faced relentless online hate. During a recent X Spaces session with fans, Cardi unleashed her fury over the vitriol Tyla has endured, questioning the very fabric of social media's relationship with celebrity culture. This isn’t just a casual rant; it's an explosive commentary on the dark side of fame in the digital age.</p>

<p>“Look at Tyla,” Cardi began, her voice dripping with frustration. “People been dragging the sh– out of Tyla and it’s, like, the girl don’t even f—ing address or talk about nothing.” This statement strikes a chord, as Cardi herself has felt the sting of public scrutiny, notably during her pregnancies. But now, it's Tyla who is in the crosshairs of social media's unforgiving spotlight.</p>

<blockquote>“I’m starting to feel that people just don’t like celebrities. It’s like the only way that people like celebrities is if you don’t f—ing say nothing at all.” - Cardi B</blockquote>

<p>Cardi's remarks come on the heels of a resurfaced TikTok from 2020, where Tyla referred to herself as a “Coloured South African.” This seemingly innocuous statement ignited a firestorm of backlash, particularly after her vague responses to questions about her ethnicity posed by Charlamagne Tha God on The Breakfast Club. According to a recent profile in Variety, this incident has only compounded the confusion and hostility surrounding her identity.</p>

<p>“To be honest with you, I don’t even know the hate about it because I never really got into the details of what is the real hard-core thing,” Cardi admitted, emphasizing the overwhelming nature of the online discourse. “However, all I do know is every single time I scroll down on my TikTok, there’s a video of her and people are talking sh–.” It appears that Tyla's every move is scrutinized and criticized, leaving Cardi exasperated. “What do you want her to f—ing do, cut her f—ing veins? Like, enough. Enough. I really think that’s what ya be wanting.”</p>

<p>But what exactly is fueling this relentless barrage of hate? Tyla herself has expressed her bewilderment over the backlash, describing her experience as “really confusing.” She admitted to understanding both sides of the story yet found herself grappling with a crisis of identity. “When who you are is challenged, especially when it’s all you’ve ever known, it shakes you,” she revealed in her Variety interview. “You want to stand your ground, because if you don’t, someone else will try to define it for you.”</p>

<blockquote>“That [controversy] was really confusing for me. I understood both sides of the story, but I was left asking, ‘OK, but what do I do now?’” - Tyla</blockquote>

<p>Tyla’s decision to sidestep Charlamagne’s probing question during a British Vogue cover story earlier this year was a strategic move that she stands by. “Me choosing not to say anything, I’m happy that I didn’t,” she asserted. “I didn’t want to explain my culture and something that is really important to me on a platform that is just going to be purposefully misconstrued.” This is a bold statement in an era where every word can be twisted and weaponized against public figures.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Tyla elaborated on the complexities of her identity, explaining the term “colored” in the context of her South African heritage versus its derogatory connotations in the United States. “If people really searched, they’ll see that in South Africa we had a lot of segregation,” she said. “It was bad for a lot of us. They just classified us.” This nuance is often lost in translation, especially when American audiences are involved. Tyla candidly admitted to experiencing cultural shock upon arriving in America, where her identity was suddenly up for debate.</p>

<p>As Cardi B continues to rally behind Tyla, calling out the immense pressure and scrutiny that comes with fame, one must wonder: will this collective celebrity outrage lead to a change in how we treat public figures? Or will the cycle of online bullying continue unabated? With Cardi's upcoming single “Imaginary Players” set to drop soon, perhaps she will channel this fury into her music, using her platform to further advocate for those like Tyla who are unfairly targeted.</p>

<p>In the meantime, the world watches as Tyla navigates her path through the treacherous waters of celebrity life, armed with the support of Cardi B and a fierce determination to define her own identity on her own terms.</p>
