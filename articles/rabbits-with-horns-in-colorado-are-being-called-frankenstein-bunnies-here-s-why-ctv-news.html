      <h2>Rabbits with ‘horns’ in Colorado are being called ‘Frankenstein bunnies.’ Here’s why</h2>

<p>DENVER — Hold onto your hats, folks! In a bizarre twist that feels plucked straight from the pages of a horror screenplay, a group of rabbits in Fort Collins, Colorado, has been spotted sporting grotesque, horn-like growths on their furry faces. Yes, you heard that right! These aren't your average bunnies; these are the so-called “Frankenstein bunnies,” also dubbed “demon rabbits” and “zombie rabbits” by locals who are both fascinated and horrified by the sight.</p>

<p>But fear not, fellow citizens! Scientists are here to assure us that there’s no reason to panic. These unfortunate cottontails are merely victims of the Shope papillomavirus, a virus that has been around for nearly a century and is mostly harmless. According to Kara Van Hoose, a spokesperson for Colorado Parks and Wildlife, this virus causes wart-like growths to sprout from the rabbits' faces, resembling horns if they grow long enough. “The growths don’t harm rabbits unless they grow on their eyes or mouths and interfere with eating,” Van Hoose explained to The Associated Press. So, while they may look like they’ve come straight from a sci-fi nightmare, these rabbits are not in immediate danger!</p>

<p>It’s important to note that the Shope papillomavirus has a rich history in both folklore and scientific research. Discovered by Dr. Richard E. Shope in the 1930s at The Rockefeller University, this virus has contributed significantly to our understanding of the connections between viruses and cancer, including the infamous human papillomavirus (HPV), which is linked to cervical cancer. The rabbit virus even inspired the age-old myth of the jackalope, a creature said to have antlers or horns, blending the realms of reality and fantasy in North America.</p>

<p>But let’s get back to the present-day horror unfolding in Fort Collins, located a mere 65 miles (105 kilometers) north of Denver. The recent sightings of these horned rabbits have sent social media into a frenzy, with residents snapping photos and sharing them online. The viral images have sparked a wave of both intrigue and disgust, leading to a flurry of unflattering nicknames that would make even a Halloween costume designer blush.</p>

<blockquote>“The growths resemble warts but can look like horns if they grow longer,” said Van Hoose, who has been fielding a barrage of calls from concerned citizens.</blockquote>

<p>In a summer full of strange occurrences, it’s no surprise that these rabbit sightings have captured the public’s imagination. With fleas and ticks being the primary culprits behind the spread of the virus, the summer months serve as the perfect breeding ground for this peculiar condition. Van Hoose emphasized that while the virus can spread from rabbit to rabbit, it poses no threat to other species, including humans and our beloved pets. Talk about a relief!</p>

<p>But let’s not kid ourselves: the sight of these rabbits is still unsettling. Imagine walking through a park and encountering a rabbit that looks like it has just emerged from a horror movie set! The juxtaposition of the cute, fluffy body with protruding horn-like growths is enough to make anyone’s skin crawl. These “Frankenstein bunnies” are a reminder of nature's strange twists, and it’s hard not to feel a mix of sympathy and bewilderment.</p>

<p>As the summer progresses, it’s likely that more sightings will be reported. Will the horned rabbits become a local attraction, drawing curious onlookers eager to catch a glimpse of these bizarre creatures? Or will they fade back into the shadows, leaving behind only tales of their grotesque appearances? One thing is for sure: the “Frankenstein bunnies” have made their mark on Fort Collins, and the community is buzzing with both fear and fascination.</p>

<p>As we wrap our heads around this peculiar phenomenon, let’s remember the importance of scientific understanding. While these horned rabbits may look alarming, they are merely a product of a common virus that has been studied for nearly a century. The Shope papillomavirus serves as a reminder of the intricate relationships between viruses and their hosts, and the ongoing journey of scientific discovery.</p>

<p>So, the next time you hear someone mention the “Frankenstein bunnies” of Colorado, you can confidently inform them that these creatures are not the stuff of nightmares, but rather a curious case of nature’s whimsy, wrapped in a layer of viral intrigue. And who knows? Maybe one day, these horned rabbits will inspire a new wave of folklore that will be passed down through generations, adding another chapter to the strange and wonderful story of our natural world.</p>
