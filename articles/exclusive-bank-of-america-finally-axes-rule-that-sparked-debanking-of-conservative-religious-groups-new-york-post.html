<h2>Exclusive | Bank of America finally axes rule that sparked ‘debanking’ of conservative religious groups</h2>

<p>In a shocking turn of events, Bank of America has finally decided to scrap a controversial rule that critics claim ignited a widespread “debanking” of charities and businesses aligned with conservative religious groups. Yes, you heard it right! After years of scrutiny and pressure, the banking giant has bowed to the demands of the very groups it was accused of targeting.</p>

<p>Sources reveal that this monumental shift comes on the heels of Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan, along with JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon, facing fierce backlash from none other than former President Donald Trump. The drama unfolded in 2021 when Trump was denied banking services after his first term. Insiders whisper that these financial titans were under intense pressure from the Biden administration to snub Trump following the infamous January 6 Capitol riots. Is this what we call political banking?</p>

<blockquote>“While we have been very clear that politics is not a factor in our decisions, we received thoughtful input from a range of stakeholders and agreed it is best to explicitly add that to our Code of Conduct,” a Bank of America spokesman declared.</blockquote>

<p>But wait! The plot thickens. Critics argue that the banks’ shunning of Trump and the MAGA movement was not merely a coincidence but rather a calculated move based on a so-called “reputational risk clause” embedded in federal regulations. This supposed clause allowed banks to deny services to customers based on the nebulous notion of reputational risk. And let’s not forget the once widely-used rule that enabled financial institutions to deny services based on religious “viewpoints.”</p>

<p>Right-leaning activists and bank executives suggest that this rule allowed “woke” bank administrators to cancel evangelical organizations simply for opposing progressive cultural norms, such as same-sex marriage. Talk about a slippery slope! Last year, major banks like JPMorgan Chase ditched the “viewpoint” rule after conservative activists raised alarms about its legality. Yet, Bank of America stubbornly held on—until now.</p>

<p>As reported by the New York Post, Bank of America amended its code of conduct in late June, explicitly stating that discrimination based on religious viewpoint will no longer be tolerated. “Religious views are not a factor in any account closing decision. Bank of America is proud to provide services to about 120,000 non-profits associated with religious organizations around the country,” the spokesman added, almost as if trying to smooth over the banking giant's tarnished image.</p>

<blockquote>“We have not turned away — and will not turn away — customers because of their political or religious affiliations,” JPMorgan stated in its 2023 annual letter to shareholders.</blockquote>

<p>But it’s not just Trump who faced the wrath of these banks. Reports indicate that as many as 12 banks rejected Trump immediately after his presidency ended, alongside other right-leaning businesses connected to the MAGA movement and even the crypto sector. This is not just a financial issue; it’s a cultural battleground!</p>

<p>In an unexpected twist, Bank of America’s recent policy change is also a significant victory for economist Jerry Bowyer, CEO of Bowyer Research. Bowyer has been tirelessly advocating for the removal of left-leaning politics from corporate practices since 2022. He has been tackling the religious debanking issue head-on, even getting a shareholder vote on JPMorgan’s ballot to end viewpoint debanking in 2023. Although he lost that vote, it ignited a dialogue that ultimately led to JPMorgan changing its policies.</p>

<p>Bowyer revealed that he discovered Bank of America’s anti-religious “viewpoint” stance after the bank booted an evangelical church in Tennessee from its platform. The church was reportedly linked to a debt collector in Uganda, but Bowyer contended that the church was merely trying to help people in an impoverished nation find work. “We met with them several times about this and asked them to change the language, and they refused; they just blew us off,” Bowyer lamented, completely unaware that the rule had been overturned just weeks prior.</p>

<blockquote>“Better late than never,” Bowyer remarked upon learning about the policy shift.</blockquote>

<p>As the dust settles, it’s clear that the debanking saga is far from over. With Trump’s recent executive order banning debanking over vague political considerations, the stakes are higher than ever. The banking industry is now under the microscope, and the public is watching closely. Will other banks follow suit, or will they continue to play political games? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure: the battle for banking freedom is heating up, and the ramifications will be felt for years to come.</p>
