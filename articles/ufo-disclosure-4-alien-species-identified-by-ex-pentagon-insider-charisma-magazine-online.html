      <h2>UFO Disclosure: 4 Alien Species Identified by Ex-Pentagon Insider</h2>

<p>U.S. Congressman Eric Burlison has revealed that credible scientists and Pentagon insiders have discussed four distinct alien species allegedly present on Earth during a Capitol Hill discussion on UFOs and Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs). The conversation occurred recently, though the exact date was not disclosed.</p>

<p>This matter has gained attention as it raises questions about government transparency and the implications of potential extraterrestrial life. Authorities, including Burlison, are calling for more information on UAPs, emphasizing the need for public disclosure regarding government funding and the research surrounding these phenomena.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Congressman Eric Burlison is a representative from Missouri.</li>
    <li>The claims about alien species were made during a discussion with physicist Dr. Eric Davis.</li>
    <li>The identified alien types include the Grays, Nordics, Insectoids, and Reptilians.</li>
    <li>This conversation took place in a non-classified setting.</li>
    <li>Burlison serves on the House Oversight Committee and the UAP caucus.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During a recent Capitol Hill discussion, Congressman Eric Burlison and physicist Dr. Eric Davis addressed the topic of UFOs and UAPs. Dr. Davis, who has worked on top-secret Pentagon projects, presented evidence suggesting the existence of four alien species. Burlison confirmed that he has encountered similar claims in prior meetings.</p>

<p>In response to questions about the most shocking claims, Burlison mentioned that some individuals allege they can mentally "call in" UFOs through telepathy. He found the frequency of such reports surprising, despite testing one claim unsuccessfully.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “I have been in meetings with individuals—not in classified settings—where they’ve brought up the four distinct classifications of aliens,” Burlison stated. “Not that I believe it. I have yet to see any evidence that that is the case. But it is something that repeatedly comes up.”
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “We as taxpayers have been funding this, whether at the Pentagon or other places where trillions of dollars have gone missing, and we’re not allowed to know about it,” Burlison added, expressing concerns about government secrecy.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous discussions on UFOs have often been met with skepticism. The current dialogue marks a significant shift in the conversation, drawing parallels to past controversies, such as the delayed disclosures surrounding the JFK assassination and questions regarding Jeffrey Epstein. The implications of possible extraterrestrial life could reshape humanity’s understanding of the universe.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>With ongoing hearings and increasing public interest, the debate surrounding UAPs and potential non-human intelligences is expected to continue. Authorities are urged to provide more transparency regarding these claims and the research funded by taxpayers.</p>
