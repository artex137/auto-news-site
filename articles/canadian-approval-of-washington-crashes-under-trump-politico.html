      <h2>Canadian Approval of Washington Crashes Under Trump</h2>

<p>In a shocking turn of events, the relationship between Canada and the United States has taken a nosedive under the Trump administration, and the implications are anything but trivial. According to a recent report from Politico, the approval ratings that once soared between our northern neighbors and the White House have plummeted, leaving many to wonder: what went wrong?</p>

<p>Let’s rewind to the good old days when Canada and the U.S. were practically best friends, sharing maple syrup and hockey games. Fast forward to now, and we see a starkly different picture painted by President Donald Trump’s controversial policies and bombastic rhetoric. It seems that the approval of the U.S. government among Canadians has crashed faster than the stock market during a recession.</p>

<blockquote>"The approval ratings have reached an all-time low,"</blockquote> a source from the Canadian government revealed, noting that public opinion has soured significantly since Trump took office in January 2017. The numbers don’t lie: a recent poll conducted by the Angus Reid Institute showed that a mere 28% of Canadians approve of the way Trump is handling his presidency. That’s a staggering drop from the 63% approval rating he enjoyed in 2016. 

<p>What has caused this seismic shift in sentiment? For starters, Trump's insistence on renegotiating NAFTA, now known as the USMCA, sent shockwaves through Canadian businesses. The trade agreement, which was a cornerstone of the economic relationship between the two countries, became a bargaining chip in Trump’s quest for a "better deal." And let’s not forget the tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum that Trump slapped on in 2018, which sent Canadian industries into a tailspin and ignited fury among politicians and citizens alike.</p>

<p>But wait, there’s more! The diplomatic faux pas didn’t stop there. Remember when Trump called Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau "very dishonest and weak" after the G7 summit in June 2018? Yes, that happened. The fallout was immediate, with Trudeau expressing his disappointment in a press conference that left many Canadians feeling embarrassed and angry. This was not just a slap on the wrist; it was an outright public humiliation.</p>

<blockquote>"I have made it clear to the president that Canada will not be pushed around,"</blockquote> Trudeau stated defiantly during a press briefing, but the damage was done. The Canadian public's trust in Trump was shattered, and approval ratings took a nosedive that has yet to recover. 

<p>Then came the border issues. Trump's controversial immigration policies, including the infamous family separation policy, drew widespread condemnation from Canadian citizens. Many felt that Canada should not be associated with the U.S. when it comes to such inhumane practices. This was a critical moment that solidified the negative perception of Trump among Canadians, pushing approval ratings further into the abyss.</p>

<p>And let’s not forget the environmental policies that have been a thorn in the side of Canadian environmentalists. Trump’s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement in 2017 was viewed as a direct affront to Canada’s commitment to combat climate change. The ripple effect of this decision has been felt across the country, as Canadians—who pride themselves on their green initiatives—watch in horror as the U.S. retreats from global environmental responsibilities.</p>

<blockquote>"The U.S. is not only hurting its own citizens but also jeopardizing the global fight against climate change,"</blockquote> a spokesperson from Canada’s Ministry of Environment stated, reflecting the widespread sentiment among Canadians. 

<p>Looking at the numbers, it’s clear that Trump’s policies have had a direct impact on the Canadian psyche. The relationship, once characterized by mutual respect and cooperation, has devolved into a saga of misunderstandings and disagreements. The latest polling data indicates that nearly 70% of Canadians feel that Trump is a negative influence on the world stage, a sentiment that resonates deeply in a country that prides itself on diplomacy and multiculturalism.</p>

<p>As we march into the 2024 elections, the question remains: will the relationship between Canada and the U.S. improve, or are we destined for continued tension? With Trump’s potential re-election looming, Canadians are left holding their breath, hoping that the next administration will breathe new life into a relationship that has, quite frankly, hit rock bottom. One thing is for sure: the Canadian approval of Washington under Trump has crashed, and there's no sign of recovery in sight.</p>

<p>So, buckle up, folks! The rollercoaster ride of U.S.-Canada relations is far from over, and as we’ve seen, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Will sanity prevail, or will we continue to spiral into absurdity? Only time will tell, but for now, Canadians are left shaking their heads in disbelief.</p>
