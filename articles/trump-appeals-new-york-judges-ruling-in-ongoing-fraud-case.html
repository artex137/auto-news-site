        <h1>Trump Appeals New York Judge's Ruling in Ongoing Fraud Case</h1>
        <p class="byline">2025-08-13 08:37 UTC</p>
        <p>Former President Donald Trump has filed an appeal against a New York judge's ruling that allows a civil fraud case to move forward. The case, brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James, alleges that Trump and his company inflated the value of assets to secure favorable loans and insurance deals.</p>

<h2>Details of the Appeal</h2>
<p>The appeal was submitted to the New York State Supreme Court's Appellate Division, following a ruling by Justice Arthur Engoron that dismissed Trump's request to dismiss the case. Trump's legal team argues that the judge's decision is flawed and that the case should not proceed.</p>

<blockquote>"This case is a political witch hunt, and we will continue to fight it in court," said Trump in a statement.</blockquote>

<p>Attorney General James has maintained that the evidence supports her claims of fraud and that the case is vital for accountability in business practices.</p>

<h2>Implications of the Case</h2>
<p>If the appeal fails, the trial could begin as early as next year. The outcome may have significant implications for Trump’s business empire and his political future as he campaigns for the 2024 presidential election.</p>
