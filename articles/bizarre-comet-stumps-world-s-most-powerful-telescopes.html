      <h2>Bizarre comet stumps world’s most powerful telescopes</h2>

<p>A newly discovered comet, labeled 3I/ATLAS, has baffled astronomers since it was first observed in July 2025. The object, which behaves like an icy comet, has exhibited unusual characteristics that challenge current classifications of interstellar visitors. NASA and several observatories, including the James Webb Space Telescope and Hubble, are actively monitoring the comet as they work to understand its peculiar signals.</p>

<p>The significance of 3I/ATLAS lies in its unusual composition and behavior, which may provide insights into the environments where such objects form. Researchers hope to decode its chemical fingerprints, which could reveal details about the early solar system and beyond.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Object Name:</strong> 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from the Sun at Activity Detection:</strong> Approximately 6 astronomical units (AU)</li>
    <li><strong>Observatories Involved:</strong> James Webb Space Telescope, Hubble Space Telescope, TESS, SPHEREx</li>
    <li><strong>Notable Composition:</strong> Highest CO₂-to-water ratio ever measured in a comet-like body</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025, prompting an international observing campaign. Within weeks, multiple observatories began redirecting their attention to the comet, leveraging their unique capabilities to gather data. Notably, the James Webb Space Telescope and SPHEREx provided valuable spectral information, revealing the object's unusual chemical composition.</p>

<p>As observations continued, researchers noted that 3I/ATLAS displayed activity at a distance where most comets remain inactive, suggesting the presence of more volatile materials. The high-resolution images from Hubble showed an atypical dust distribution, leading to various hypotheses regarding the object's formation and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and so far the evidence points to a chemically unusual, physically asymmetric interstellar object rather than anything definitively artificial,” said a leading astronomer involved in the research.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a growing list of interstellar objects that challenge existing models of cometary behavior. Previous events have shown that comets can exhibit a range of activities influenced by their environments. The study of such objects is crucial for understanding the formation and evolution of solar systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its trajectory near Mars, Venus, and Jupiter, scientists plan to conduct further observations. They aim to refine their models of interstellar bodies and investigate the comet's changing activity as it approaches the Sun. The coordinated observing campaigns will seek to answer key questions about the comet's composition and behavior.</p>
