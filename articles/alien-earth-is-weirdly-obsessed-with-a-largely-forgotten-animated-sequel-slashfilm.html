      <h2>Alien: Earth Is Weirdly Obsessed With A Largely Forgotten Animated Sequel</h2>

<p>In a shocking twist that has left audiences scratching their heads and rolling their eyes, FX's new sci-fi series "Alien: Earth" is revealing an uncanny obsession with none other than "Ice Age: Continental Drift," the 2012 animated sequel that somehow holds the spotlight in a universe dominated by extraterrestrial horror. Yes, you read that right! In a world where Ridley Scott's 1979 classic "Alien" reigns supreme, we are inexplicably led down the rabbit hole of a film that boasts a dismal 37% on Rotten Tomatoes. What gives?</p>

<p>In the two-episode premiere, aired on FX, the show dives headfirst into the bizarre minds of its characters, particularly Wendy, played by Sydney Chandler, who is introduced as the world's first "hybrid" - a human consciousness grafted onto a synthetic body. The year is 2120, but Wendy's fixation on "Ice Age: Continental Drift" makes viewers question if she’s been time-traveling back to a childhood marred by questionable cinematic choices. It’s almost as if the creators are daring us to ask, “Is this really what the future holds for humanity?”</p>

<blockquote>“There’s no doubt more to the ‘Ice Age’ memory than meets the eye.”</blockquote>

<p>The premise gets even stranger as Wendy turns to her stuffed animal pals for comfort while reliving the glory days of her childhood, which revolve around watching Sid the sloth (voiced by John Leguizamo) muddle through a joke about "fury" and "furry." This heartwarming yet perplexing nostalgia raises eyebrows: Is this really the pinnacle of pop culture we want to carry into the future? The creators seem to think so, but why? What does the "Ice Age" legacy have to do with the existential dread of "Alien"? Are we to believe that in 2120, the memories of poorly received animated films will somehow become the bedrock of human experience?</p>

<p>Wendy and her brother Hermit (Alex Lawther) share this peculiar connection, which is highlighted in a flashback just a day before their spaceship crashes into a New Siam apartment complex. In this scene, Wendy manipulates a robot at a government building to quote from "Ice Age," leading Hermit to recognize the line “have a heart or face my furry.” This moment is intended to strike a deeper existential chord, but how can we take it seriously when it’s rooted in a film that most would rather forget?</p>

<blockquote>“The kids clearly had a strained relationship with their father, and Wendy ended up terminally ill.”</blockquote>

<p>Wendy's backstory is equally perplexing. After a traumatic childhood and a strained relationship with her father, she finds herself at Prodigy headquarters, terminally ill and without the option to return home. One can’t help but wonder if the filmmakers are using "Ice Age: Continental Drift" as a metaphor for the fleeting nature of happiness amidst chaos, but it feels more like a desperate attempt to cling to nostalgia that simply doesn’t hold up. Is this really the best we can do in terms of cultural references in a post-apocalyptic future?</p>

<p>Noah Hawley, the genius behind FX's "Fargo" and the mind-bending "Legion," is known for his eclectic pop culture references. Yet, the inclusion of "Ice Age" stands out as particularly peculiar. Just last year, he inserted a Marilyn Manson cover of "This Is Halloween" into a tense scene in "Fargo," but that seems tame compared to the earnestness with which "Ice Age" is treated in "Alien: Earth." The bizarre juxtaposition raises more questions than answers. Are we witnessing a creative breakdown or a bold statement on the nature of memory and nostalgia?</p>

<blockquote>“The show’s timeline already feels intentionally ambiguous.”</blockquote>

<p>As if the plot wasn’t confusing enough, the timeline of "Alien: Earth" adds layers of ambiguity that could leave even the most astute sci-fi fans scratching their heads. On-screen captions inform us that the spaceship crash and the Xenomorph debut occur just two years before the original "Alien" film, but the pop culture references span decades. How are Wendy and Hermit so well-versed in 20th-century Major League Baseball and Disney classics while living in a time that should be light-years ahead?</p>

<p>The show’s creators seem to be playing with the idea that whatever pop culture we cherish in our formative years might somehow endure through time. But is it really a stretch to believe that "Ice Age: Continental Drift" could somehow be cherished in 2120? Or is this just another case of art imitating life, with Hawley’s own nostalgia bleeding into the fabric of his narrative? After all, he grew up in the 1970s, while his son, who makes his acting debut in the show, was born in the 2010s. Could it be that we are merely witnessing a bizarre reflection of our own cultural obsessions?</p>

<p>As new episodes of "Alien: Earth" continue to drop on FX and Hulu every Tuesday at 8 PM ET, one can only hope that the show will offer a clearer vision of what the future holds for humanity. Until then, we’re left to ponder: Will "Ice Age: Continental Drift" be our cultural savior, or is it just another misstep in a long line of cinematic follies?</p>
