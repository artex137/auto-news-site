      <h2>‘Comet’ could be nuclear-powered, Harvard scientist says</h2>

<p>A Harvard scientist has suggested that the comet 3I ATLAS may be powered by nuclear energy, according to a recent report. The claim has raised interest among astronomers and space enthusiasts alike, as the comet approaches Earth.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant because it could reshape our understanding of cometary bodies and their energy sources. Researchers are currently analyzing the comet's trajectory and composition to determine the validity of these claims.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Comet 3I ATLAS is currently approaching Earth.</li>
    <li>The claim of nuclear power was made by a Harvard scientist.</li>
    <li>No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</li>
    <li>Details on the comet's exact trajectory are not disclosed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I ATLAS was first detected in 2019. Since then, it has been monitored by various space agencies. The recent claim regarding its potential nuclear power has sparked renewed interest in the comet's study.</p>

<p>As of now, astronomers are conducting further observations to gather more data on its composition and behavior.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The possibility of nuclear energy being present in a comet opens up new avenues for research,” said the Harvard scientist, emphasizing the importance of further investigation.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Previous studies of comets have primarily focused on their icy compositions and organic materials. The suggestion that a comet could utilize nuclear energy is unprecedented and could lead to significant advancements in astrophysics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers will continue to monitor 3I ATLAS for additional data, with upcoming observations scheduled in the next few weeks to confirm the initial findings regarding its potential nuclear power.</p>
