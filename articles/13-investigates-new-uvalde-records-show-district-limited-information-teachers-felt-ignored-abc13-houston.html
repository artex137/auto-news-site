      <h2>Uvalde's Dark Secrets: Teachers Ignored, Records Withheld, and a Community Left in the Dark</h2>

<p>In a shocking revelation that has left the Uvalde community reeling, new records obtained by ABC13 Houston have exposed a disturbing pattern of information suppression and neglect following the tragic shooting at Robb Elementary School, where 19 children and two teachers were brutally murdered on May 24, 2022. As the dust settles from this unimaginable horror, it appears that the very institution meant to protect and educate has turned its back on those who sacrificed everything.</p>

<p>In an email dated June 12, 2022, a Robb Elementary teacher, who found herself in the line of fire, expressed her anguish to the district's superintendent. "It feels like our sacrifice and pain doesn't matter," she lamented. This heartfelt message was not just a cry for help but a desperate plea for acknowledgment from an administration that seems to have opted for silence instead of support. The teacher recounted the harrowing moments during the shooting: "I physically sat almost laying myself on my students... I knew I would die that day," she wrote, detailing the blood and shrapnel that marked her survival.</p>

<p>Despite such chilling accounts, the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District (CISD) has been embroiled in a years-long battle to withhold critical documents from public scrutiny. The recently released emails paint a grim picture of a district more concerned with protecting its image than addressing the needs of its traumatized staff and students. One email from Uvalde CISD’s director of student services, sent just four days post-massacre, warned nearly 20 employees against sharing safety plans with the media, emphasizing, "This is one person's fault and that is the shooter." Such rhetoric seems to deflect responsibility from the district's own failures.</p>

<blockquote>“I told my students I loved them, I told them to stay quiet, and I told them to pray.”</blockquote>

<p>The details of the shooter's background only add to the horror. Salvador Ramos, the now-deceased assailant, had a troubling history that was glaringly ignored by the school district. His records show a staggering 161 absences during the 2019-2020 school year, and he was ranked 312th out of 318 students. His disciplinary file was littered with suspensions for offenses as trivial as flashing the "loser" sign at teachers. Yet, despite these warning signs, it took a devastating act of violence for the community to confront the reality of their educational system's failures.</p>

<p>And what of the police response? The Uvalde CISD police, along with other first responders, stood idle for a shocking 77 minutes outside the classroom as the shooting unfolded. This is not just a failure; it is an indictment of a system that failed to protect its most vulnerable. The aftermath of this negligence has resulted in Uvalde CISD Police Chief Pete Arredondo facing ten counts of child endangerment and abandonment. His attorney, Paul Looney, has decried the attempts to keep information secret, stating, "Much is being made of trying to keep information private and secret so that they can try to prosecute two officers." Looney suggests that the district's attempts to shield its failures are not only misguided but are also hindering the learning necessary to prevent future tragedies.</p>

<p>The Uvalde community has been left in a state of disbelief. After receiving a request for comment from ABC13, the district responded with a curt statement, citing "current workload and the district's priorities" as reasons for their inability to meet the inquiry's deadline. This lack of urgency and transparency is a slap in the face to those still mourning the loss of their loved ones.</p>

<blockquote>“It feels like our sacrifice and pain doesn’t matter.”</blockquote>

<p>In a bizarre twist, the school district took to social media to inform the community about the release of these records, promising transparency while simultaneously demonstrating an alarming level of insensitivity. "We recognize the profound impact this tragedy continues to have on everyone involved," they stated, but one must wonder: How can a district that has so blatantly ignored its own teachers and students claim to prioritize their healing and support?</p>

<p>As we sift through these revelations, one thing becomes clear: the Uvalde CISD has a long way to go in rebuilding trust with its community. The pain of the survivors, the families of the victims, and the teachers who risked their lives has been met with a wall of silence and secrecy. The time for accountability is now, and the people of Uvalde deserve more than empty promises; they deserve action, transparency, and above all, recognition of their suffering.</p>

<p>The question remains: Will the Uvalde school district finally listen to those they have so callously ignored, or will the community continue to bear the burden of their silence?</p>
