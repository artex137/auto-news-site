<h2>Alien: Earth Showrunner Says There's Still Something 'Really Scary' About Ridley Scott's Original Alien Ending Idea Where the Xenomorph Kills Ripley and Mimics Her Voice</h2>

<p>In a bombshell revelation that could send chills down the spine of every Alien fan, FX's showrunner Noah Hawley has resurrected a chilling concept from the depths of sci-fi horror history—an original ending for Ridley Scott's 1979 masterpiece that would have forever altered the franchise's trajectory. Imagine this: the xenomorph, the epitome of extraterrestrial terror, slaying the iconic Ripley, played by the indomitable Sigourney Weaver, then using her voice to lure humanity into its nightmarish grasp. Yes, you read that right! This spine-tingling concept was tossed aside by Scott, but Hawley believes it still holds a terrifying power.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There’s still something very scary to it,” Hawley told Yahoo UK, recalling Scott's original vision. “Ridley told me that he wanted to have the xenomorph kill Ripley and then get on the radio and mimic her voice and then head off to Earth.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What could have been! This dark twist would have not only reshaped Alien's haunting legacy but also paved the way for an entirely different series of sequels. Instead of the triumphant finale where Ripley, the last survivor of the doomed Nostromo, destroys the xenomorph and sets a course for Earth, we would have witnessed a chilling invasion of the body snatchers scenario, as the creature impersonates its victim. Hawley reflects on this sinister notion, noting how the manipulation of voice and identity taps into primal fears that resonate deeply within audiences.</p>

<p>Scott’s decision to scrap this hair-raising ending is now viewed as a stroke of genius. The iconic moment where Ripley records her final log, drifting into stasis as the sole survivor, has become one of cinema’s most memorable conclusions. Yet, the thought of a xenomorph recording that log instead is enough to make any fan’s skin crawl. Just imagine: the alien, with its grotesque visage, mimicking Ripley's voice as it heads toward Earth, ready to unleash chaos upon humanity. It's a terrifying prospect that would have turned the beloved franchise into a full-blown horror saga.</p>

<h2>Alien: Earth—A New Chapter in the Franchise</h2>

<p>Fast forward to today, and Hawley is steering the franchise into uncharted territory with the upcoming FX series, Alien: Earth. Set just a few years before the events of the original film, this new chapter introduces viewers to the USCSS Maginot, a deep space research vessel that crash-lands on Earth. The stakes are high as Wendy, played by Sydney Chandler, and a group of tactical soldiers make a “fateful discovery” that puts them face-to-face with the xenomorphs we all know and dread, along with a slew of never-before-seen alien species.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Anything that has to do with our face and our eyes and the loss of control, I think, is a really interesting thing to do to an audience,” Hawley elaborated, hinting at the new horrors that await viewers in Alien: Earth.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But Hawley isn’t just recycling old ideas; he’s creating a new arsenal of alien terror. Among the newly imagined species is one that takes control of its victims through their eyes—an unsettling concept that speaks to our deepest fears of losing autonomy and control. This fresh approach aligns perfectly with the franchise’s established themes of horror and existential dread.</p>

<p>However, it’s not just the xenomorphs that pose a threat. Earth, in this timeline, is governed by five powerful corporations, including the infamous Weyland-Yutani, alongside Prodigy, which owns the city where the Maginot crash-lands. The introduction of hybrids—humanoid robots infused with human consciousness—adds another layer of complexity to the narrative. Wendy, as the first hybrid prototype, embodies the franchise's ongoing exploration of immortality and the blurred lines between humanity and technology.</p>

<h2>Forget Prometheus—Hawley Sticks to the Roots</h2>

<p>In a bold move, Hawley has opted to disregard the convoluted backstory provided in the divisive Prometheus, favoring the “retro-futurism” aesthetic of the original films. “I like the lore of the original films,” he stated, emphasizing his desire to return to the franchise’s roots while still pushing the boundaries of its mythology. This decision has sparked conversations among fans about the potential directions the series may take, and whether it can recapture the raw terror of its predecessors.</p>

<p>As anticipation builds for Alien: Earth, one thing is certain: Hawley’s willingness to explore the darker corners of the Alien mythos promises a thrilling ride. Whether it’s the haunting echoes of Scott’s abandoned ending or the introduction of new horrors, the series aims to reignite that sense of dread that made the original film a cornerstone of sci-fi horror. Will it succeed? Only time will tell, but one thing is for sure—the xenomorphs are back, and they’re as terrifying as ever.</p>
