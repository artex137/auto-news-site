      <h2>‘This is America’: New Jersey Gym Teacher’s Outrageous Bullying of Muslim Student Exposed in Shocking Lawsuit</h2>

<p>In a jaw-dropping turn of events that has left many questioning the integrity of our educational institutions, a former gym teacher in New Jersey is facing serious allegations of bullying a student based on her Egyptian heritage and Muslim faith. The lawsuit, filed by 19-year-old Jana Gadalla, reveals a disturbing pattern of behavior that would make any reasonable person cringe. This incident raises critical questions about the treatment of minority students in schools across America.</p>

<p>Jana Gadalla, who recently graduated from Bridgewater-Raritan High School, has named Kathie DeBonis, the school’s principal Vincent DelPriore, and the entire school district as defendants in her suit. The allegations are nothing short of appalling. According to the lawsuit, during the 2022-2023 school year, DeBonis, who was also a long-time girls' lacrosse coach and health teacher, made a series of derogatory remarks aimed at Gadalla’s ethnicity and religion.</p>

<blockquote>“This is America,” DeBonis allegedly told Gadalla, followed by the shocking prediction that “by the time you are 16 you will probably be in jail anyway.”</blockquote>

<p>This chilling statement is not just a casual remark but a blatant example of the systemic racism that continues to plague American society. How can anyone justify telling a young Muslim girl that her future is destined for incarceration simply based on her background? The lawsuit paints a picture of a toxic environment where Gadalla was subjected to relentless harassment.</p>

<p>But the harassment didn’t stop there. During Ramadan, a sacred month for Muslims, DeBonis allegedly told Gadalla, “If I were you, I would just go drink alcohol.” Such a comment not only shows a lack of respect for Gadalla’s faith but also demonstrates a complete disregard for cultural sensitivity. It’s astonishing that a teacher would feel empowered to make such an inappropriate statement.</p>

<blockquote>“It’s good that you’re fasting during Ramadan, maybe you’ll lose some weight,” DeBonis allegedly remarked, further undermining Gadalla’s self-esteem.</blockquote>

<p>In a particularly cruel twist, DeBonis is accused of calling Gadalla “obese” and then assigning her a humiliating three-page paper on obesity, which she had to complete before being allowed to use the bathroom. This kind of punitive action raises serious questions about DeBonis' judgment and her ability to fulfill her responsibilities as an educator.</p>

<p>The lawsuit details Gadalla’s desperate attempts to seek help. She approached principal Vincent DelPriore and her school counselor to report the abuse, resulting in her being moved out of DeBonis’ class. However, the retaliation didn’t stop there; DeBonis reportedly asked, “Who snitched to the principal?”—a clear indication that she was more concerned about her own reputation than the well-being of her students.</p>

<p>Gadalla’s lawsuit claims that the emotional toll of DeBonis’ bullying led to “physical manifestations of emotional distress as well as personal hardships including anxiety, adjustment problems, sleep disturbance, humiliation, and mental pain and anguish.” This is a stark reminder of the real, damaging effects that bullying can have, particularly when it is perpetrated by someone in a position of authority.</p>

<p>What’s even more shocking is that DeBonis has now retired and is reportedly collecting an annual pension of $70,000. How can a teacher who has allegedly engaged in such egregious behavior continue to benefit financially from a system that should hold her accountable? The school district is set to respond to the lawsuit by August 29, and many are eagerly awaiting their defense—or lack thereof.</p>

<p>Gadalla’s experience is not just an isolated incident but part of a larger narrative that highlights the challenges faced by minority students in American schools. The lawsuit explicitly notes that DeBonis did not “mock, shame or make inappropriate comments to light-skinned non-Muslim, non-Egyptian students,” indicating that the bullying was not only targeted but systematic.</p>

<p>As America grapples with issues of race, religion, and equality, this case serves as a crucial reminder that we must remain vigilant against discrimination in all its forms. The voices of students like Jana Gadalla must be heard, and the actions of educators must be scrutinized to ensure that schools are safe and inclusive environments for all.</p>

<p>In a nation that prides itself on diversity and acceptance, the allegations against DeBonis serve as a stark reminder that we still have a long way to go. Will justice be served in this case? Only time will tell, but the eyes of the nation are watching closely.</p>
