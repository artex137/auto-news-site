      <h2>Does 3I/ATLAS Generate Its Own Light?</h2>

<p>Avi Loeb, an astrophysicist at Harvard University, has raised questions about the nature of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS, which was observed by the Hubble Space Telescope on July 21, 2025. The object appears to emit a glow likely from a coma, but lacks evidence of a cometary tail. This discovery suggests that 3I/ATLAS may generate its own light, rather than merely reflecting sunlight.</p>

<p>This finding has significant implications for our understanding of interstellar objects. Loeb and his colleague, Eric Keto, suggest that if 3I/ATLAS produces its own light, it could be much smaller than previously estimated. Current models suggest a diameter of up to 20 kilometers, which Loeb argues is untenable given the limited material available in interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Observation Date: July 21, 2025</li>
    <li>Observation Method: Hubble Space Telescope</li>
    <li>Proximity to Mars: 28.96 million kilometers on October 3, 2025</li>
    <li>Estimated Luminosity: 10 gigawatts</li>
    <li>Diameter Estimate: Potentially less than 100 meters</li>
    <li>Predicted Size from Reflection Model: Up to 20 kilometers</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured the first significant image of 3I/ATLAS, revealing a glow ahead of its motion towards the Sun. Following this, Loeb and Keto analyzed the brightness profile of the object and proposed that the observed glow could indicate a central light source rather than sunlight reflection.</p>

<p>On the night of the discovery, Loeb participated in an annual soccer match at Harvard, where he scored two goals for the faculty team, but the students won 3-2. The following morning, he began calculations regarding the luminosity and size of 3I/ATLAS, leading to his current hypotheses about its nature.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“The simplest interpretation is that the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS produces most of the light,” said Avi Loeb. “If 3I/ATLAS generates its own light, then it could be much smaller than expected.”</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is part of a growing interest in interstellar objects, following the discovery of 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These previous objects have raised questions about the composition and behavior of materials originating from outside our solar system. The study of 3I/ATLAS could provide further insights into these phenomena.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The HiRISE team on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has expressed willingness to observe 3I/ATLAS during its close pass to Mars in October 2025. More data collected from these observations will aid in understanding the object's nature and characteristics.</p>
