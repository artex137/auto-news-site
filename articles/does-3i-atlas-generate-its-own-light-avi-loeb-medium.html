      <h2>Does 3I/ATLAS Generate Its Own Light?</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has captured the best image of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS on July 21, 2025, revealing a glow of light likely produced by a coma ahead of its motion toward the Sun. No evidence of a cometary tail has been found, and the glow is theorized to result from dust evaporation on the Sun-facing side of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>This discovery raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS and its size. Researchers, including Avi Loeb and Eric Keto, propose that the observed brightness profile may indicate that 3I/ATLAS generates its own light, which could mean it is significantly smaller than previously estimated. Current models suggest it could have a diameter of up to 20 kilometers, but this is seen as untenable due to the limited availability of rocky material in interstellar space.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Date of image capture:</strong> July 21, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Distance from Mars:</strong> 28.96 (+/-0.06) million kilometers, expected on October 3, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Mass loss rate:</strong> 6–60 kilograms per second</li>
    <li><strong>Dust ejection speed:</strong> 20–2 kilometers per second</li>
    <li><strong>Effective surface temperature:</strong> Below 1000 degrees Kelvin ruled out</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured an image of 3I/ATLAS, revealing a glow indicative of dust evaporation. Subsequent analysis suggested that the glow might be the result of a central light source rather than sunlight reflection. Research continues to determine the characteristics and origins of this interstellar object.</p>

<p>On the evening of the soccer cup match at Harvard’s Institute for Theory & Computation, Avi Loeb, who serves as director, scored two goals for the faculty team, which lost 3-2 to the students. The following morning, he began further analysis of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The simplest interpretation is that the nucleus of 3I/ATLAS produces most of the light."</blockquote>

<blockquote>Loeb further noted, "The more data we collect on 3I/ATLAS, the closer we will get to understanding its nature."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of several interstellar objects observed in recent years, including 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These previous encounters have sparked interest in the characteristics and origins of such objects, contributing to ongoing research in astrophysics.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>The HiRISE team on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is expected to observe 3I/ATLAS during its close approach in early October 2025, aiming to gather more data to better understand its properties and behavior.</p>
