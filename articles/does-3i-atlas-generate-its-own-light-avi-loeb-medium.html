      <p class="byline">Published 2025-08-17 15:02 UTC</p>

      <h2>Does 3I/ATLAS Generate Its Own Light?</h2>

<p>The Hubble Space Telescope has provided the best image of the interstellar object 3I/ATLAS on July 21, 2025, revealing a glow of light likely from a coma ahead of its motion towards the Sun. No cometary tail has been observed, leading researchers to suggest that this glow results from dust evaporation on the Sun-facing side of 3I/ATLAS.</p>

<p>This finding raises questions about the nature of 3I/ATLAS. Avi Loeb, a researcher at Harvard, has proposed that 3I/ATLAS may generate its own light rather than simply reflecting sunlight. This hypothesis challenges previous estimates of its size, suggesting it could be significantly smaller than the 20-kilometer diameter inferred from the reflection model.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3I/ATLAS was imaged by the Hubble Space Telescope on July 21, 2025.</li>
    <li>The object is expected to pass within 28.96 million kilometers of Mars on October 3, 2025.</li>
    <li>Avi Loeb is the director of the Institute for Theory and Computation at Harvard University.</li>
    <li>3I/ATLAS shows a steep brightness profile with a projected power-law slope of -4.</li>
    <li>The luminosity of 3I/ATLAS is calculated to be around 10 gigawatts.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On July 21, 2025, the Hubble Space Telescope captured an image of 3I/ATLAS, revealing a glow consistent with dust evaporation. Following this, Avi Loeb and his colleague Eric Keto analyzed the brightness profile and proposed that the object may generate its own light.</p>
<p>Loeb calculated that if 3I/ATLAS produces its own light, it could be much smaller than previously thought, with a potential diameter under 100 meters. This conclusion contrasts with earlier models suggesting a size of up to 20 kilometers based on sunlight reflection.</p>
<p>Loeb has called for observations of 3I/ATLAS using the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter during its close approach to Mars in October 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb stated, "The nucleus dominates the observed light. This must hold irrespective of the origin of the light."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is one of several interstellar objects observed in recent years. Previous objects, such as 1I/`Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, have also prompted discussions regarding their origins and characteristics. The potential for 3I/ATLAS to be a technological object has emerged due to its unusual brightness profile and trajectory.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Researchers plan to gather more data on 3I/ATLAS during its close approach to Mars in October 2025, which could provide further insights into its nature and characteristics.</p>
