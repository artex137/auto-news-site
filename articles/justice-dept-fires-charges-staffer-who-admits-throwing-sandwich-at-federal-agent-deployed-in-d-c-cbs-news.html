<h2>Justice Dept. Fires Staffer for Throwing Sandwich at Federal Agent: A Deep State Scandal Unfolds</h2>

<p>In a jaw-dropping turn of events that could only be described as a scene from a dystopian comedy, a Justice Department staffer has been fired and charged after admitting to throwing a sandwich at a federal agent in Washington, D.C. This shocking incident unfolded on August 14, 2025, when Sean Dunn, a trial attorney working in the Office of International Affairs within the department's Criminal Division, decided that a "submarine-style sandwich" was an appropriate projectile against law enforcement.</p>

<p>Attorney General Pam Bondi wasted no time in addressing this outrageous behavior, declaring in a post on X (formerly known as Twitter), "I just learned that this defendant worked at the Department of Justice — NO LONGER. Not only is he FIRED, he has been charged with a felony." Dunn's antics have raised eyebrows and questions about the very fabric of our government, with Bondi labeling this as a clear example of the "Deep State" that has plagued the DOJ for months.</p>

<blockquote>"Why are you here? I don't want you in my city," Dunn allegedly shouted at the Customs and Border Patrol officer before hurling the sandwich. This statement encapsulates the growing tension between citizens and law enforcement in our nation's capital.</blockquote>

<p>According to charging documents, the incident took place at a busy intersection in Northwest Washington, D.C., where Dunn was caught on video yelling at the federal agent before launching his culinary attack. Witnesses report that he attempted to flee the scene on foot, a move that only underscores the absurdity of the situation. Dunn was swiftly apprehended, and in a moment of startling honesty, confessed to the crime, stating, "I did it. I threw a sandwich."</p>

<p>But wait, it gets weirder. While Dunn's sandwich-throwing escapade might seem trivial, it raises serious questions about the conduct of those employed by the Justice Department. Is this the kind of behavior we expect from someone who is supposed to uphold the law? The fact that he was a trial attorney adds a layer of irony to the entire situation. The DOJ is supposed to be a bastion of justice, yet here we have one of its own launching deli meats at law enforcement officers!</p>

<p>Jeanine Pirro, the U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., took to social media to express her outrage, stating, "We are going to back the police to the hilt. So there, stick your Subway sandwich somewhere else." Her fiery rhetoric echoes the frustrations felt by many Americans who see this as an affront to the rule of law.</p>

<p>Coincidentally, this incident occurred in the same week that federal law enforcement and National Guard members were deployed to the District of Columbia, ostensibly to combat crime—despite reports indicating that crime rates have been on the decline in recent years. What does this say about the current state of our justice system? Are we really under siege by a "Deep State" that includes sandwich-throwing attorneys?</p>

<p>As this bizarre story continues to unfold, many are left wondering what repercussions Dunn will face. He is currently charged with one count of assaulting federal law enforcement, but as of Thursday afternoon, no plea has been entered, nor has a hearing been scheduled. Perhaps the most astonishing aspect of this saga is the fact that a man who once held a position of authority within the DOJ could so brazenly disrespect the very institution he was a part of.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting that this isn’t just an isolated incident. The "Deep State" narrative has gained traction among certain political factions, who claim that entrenched bureaucrats are undermining the will of the people. Dunn's actions, while seemingly absurd, may serve as a rallying cry for those who believe that the system is rigged against ordinary citizens. In a way, he has unwittingly become a symbol of the frustrations felt by many who feel marginalized by government actions.</p>

<p>As we continue to grapple with the implications of Dunn's sandwich-throwing incident, one thing is clear: the political landscape is fraught with tension, and the line between law enforcement and the public is becoming increasingly blurred. With the DOJ under scrutiny and accusations of a "Deep State" lurking in the shadows, we must ask ourselves: how far are we willing to let this madness go?</p>

<p>In the end, whether you see Dunn as a misguided hero fighting against an oppressive regime or as a misguided fool throwing away his career (and a sandwich), one thing is certain: this incident has opened a Pandora's box of questions that may take years to unravel. Stay tuned, America. The saga is far from over.</p>
