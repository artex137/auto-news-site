      <h2>New Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) Discovered</h2>
<p>A new comet, officially named C/2025 R2 (SWAN), was discovered on Friday, September 12, 2025, by the Solar Wind Anisotropies (SWAN) instrument on the SOHO spacecraft. The comet is currently not visible to the naked eye but may be spotted with powerful binoculars.</p>

<h2>Why This Matters</h2>
<p>The discovery of C/2025 R2 (SWAN) is significant as it marks the comet's first appearance in over 22,000 years. NASA/JPL has calculated its orbit, revealing that it will return to the vicinity of Earth in the year 24,579. This comet's approach may also lead to a meteor shower as Earth crosses its orbit.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: September 12, 2025</li>
    <li>Brightness: Magnitude 7</li>
    <li>Closest approach to Earth: 39 million kilometres (between October 12–19, 2025)</li>
    <li>Perihelion: 75 million kilometres from the Sun on September 12, 2025</li>
    <li>Orbit period: 22,554 years</li>
    <li>Longest tail observed: 2.5 degrees</li>
    <li>Current visibility: Low on the western horizon in the southern US</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>The comet reached perihelion on September 12, 2025, at a distance of 75 million kilometres from the Sun. Following its discovery, NASA/JPL began calculations to track its orbit, confirming that Earth will cross its path on October 5, 2025. The closest approach to Earth is expected between October 12 and 19, 2025.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“C/2025 R2 (SWAN) originated from the direction of the Sun relative to Earth, which is why it wasn’t spotted until recently,” said a representative from NASA.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet C/2025 R2 (SWAN) is notable for its long orbital period of 22,554 years, making its return a rare event. The comet was detected using advanced astronomical instruments, reflecting ongoing advancements in space observation technology.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As Earth approaches the comet's orbit, astronomers will continue to monitor its trajectory and visibility, preparing for potential meteor showers during the crossing on October 5, 2025.</p>
