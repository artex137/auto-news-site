      <h2>What We Know about Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>3I/ATLAS, the third confirmed interstellar object and the second comet from outside the Solar System, was discovered by the NASA-funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on July 1, 2025. The comet arrived from the direction of the constellation Sagittarius. Its orbit is the most dynamically extreme of any recorded object in the Solar System.</p>

<p>This discovery is significant as it provides astronomers with a rare opportunity to study an interstellar object. According to Northeastern University astronomer Jacqueline McCleary, “Interstellar objects, which all seem to be comets, are the only things that we’ve ever gotten physical observations for within our Solar System that originated outside the Solar System.” The comet's unique characteristics may offer insights into the formation of other solar systems.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Discovered: July 1, 2025</li>
    <li>Origin: Likely from the Milky Way bulge</li>
    <li>Comet Type: 3I/ATLAS, also known as C/2025 N1 (ATLAS) and A11pl3Z</li>
    <li>Composition: Carbon dioxide ice-to-water ice ratio of 8:1</li>
    <li>Observation Tools: Multi-Object Spectrograph at the Gemini North telescope, James Webb Space Telescope, NASA’s Juno satellite</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS was discovered on July 1, 2025, by the ATLAS program. Initial observations indicated it was not a typical comet as it appeared to emit its own light, which is unusual for a comet at such a distance from the Sun. As observations continued, the comet was found to have a comet-like tail and a unique composition.</p>

<p>In the months following its discovery, astronomers conducted further studies, revealing its high carbon dioxide content and unusual ice composition. The comet is expected to cross the orbit of Jupiter after October 2025, which will provide an opportunity for closer observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“It might not be aliens making first contact, yet 3I/ATLAS, as only the third documented interstellar object to pass through the Solar System, still has plenty to teach us,” said Jacqueline McCleary, Northeastern University astronomer.</blockquote>

<blockquote>“There are so few interstellar objects that we’ve detected in our Solar System, and they each seem to be unique,” said Adina Feinstein, Michigan State University astronomer.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS follows the discovery of 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov, both of which also originated from outside the Solar System. These objects are significant for understanding the diversity and characteristics of celestial bodies beyond our Solar System.</p>

<p>The study of interstellar comets like 3I/ATLAS helps refine models of solar system formation and provides insight into the conditions that may exist in other planetary systems.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>After crossing the orbit of Jupiter, scientists will conduct further observations to learn more about 3I/ATLAS. The Juno satellite will be in a prime position to gather data on the comet's composition and behavior as it approaches the Sun.</p>
