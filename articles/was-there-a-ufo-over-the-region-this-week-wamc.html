      <h2>UFO Sighting Over Eastern U.S. Turns Out to Be Rocket Launch</h2>

<p>A bright object spotted moving across the sky on Tuesday night has been identified as a rocket launch, according to local astronomers. The phenomenon occurred during the Perseid meteor shower viewing event in the eastern United States, with observers noting the unusual sighting in the night sky.</p>

<p>The sighting has raised interest among the public and astronomers alike, as many initially speculated about the possibility of a UFO. Seth McGowan, President of the Adirondack Sky Center and Observatory, confirmed that the object was a rocket, alleviating concerns of an unidentified flying object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred on Tuesday night, date not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Location: Eastern United States, specific locations not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Observers included attendees of the Perseid meteor shower event.</li>
    <li>Two rockets launched within approximately 30 minutes of each other.</li>
    <li>Rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, for the United States Space Force.</li>
    <li>European Ariane 6 rocket launched from French Guiana.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>During the Perseid meteor shower event, attendees witnessed a large, misshapen orb moving from west to north across the night sky. Seth McGowan described the object and noted the initial confusion among observers. After a few minutes, astronomer Gordie Duvall identified the object as a rocket.</p>

<p>McGowan explained that the object seen was the solid booster rockets being jettisoned during the launch. The first stage burned for approximately five minutes, followed by the second stage glowing briefly. The launch from Cape Canaveral was confirmed to be heading east over the Atlantic.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “From seemingly out of nowhere a very large misshapen orb seemed to be floating across the sky from the west heading north,” said Seth McGowan, President of the Adirondack Sky Center and Observatory.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It was actually a really interesting coincidence. There were two different rocket launches within about a half-hour of each other,” said Christian Bradley Hubbs, Planetarium Manager at the Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Rocket launches are not uncommon, especially during specific times when conditions allow for visibility. According to Bradley Hubbs, rocket stages can often be seen in the evening sky when illuminated by sunlight.</p>

<p>This incident highlights the importance of public awareness regarding rocket launches, as misidentifications can lead to speculation about unidentified flying objects.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>No further investigations are expected regarding this incident, as it has been confirmed to be a rocket launch. Future rocket launches will likely continue to attract public attention, especially during astronomical events.</p>
