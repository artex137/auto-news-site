      <h2>Was there a UFO over the region this week?</h2>

<p>A bright object moving through the skies was observed in the eastern United States on Tuesday night, surprising spectators watching the Perseid meteor shower. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>This sighting has raised questions about unidentified aerial phenomena and sparked interest among local astronomers. Authorities have confirmed that the object was a rocket, alleviating concerns that it might be a UFO.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred on Tuesday night, August 15, 2023.</li>
    <li>Location: Eastern United States, observed by spectators in various areas.</li>
    <li>Two rocket launches took place within a half-hour of each other.</li>
    <li>First launch: United States Space Force from Cape Canaveral, Florida.</li>
    <li>Second launch: European Ariane 6 rocket from French Guiana.</li>
    <li>Object was seen moving northward across the sky.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Tuesday night, August 15, 2023, spectators gathered to view the Perseid meteor shower when they noticed a large, bright object moving across the sky. Seth McGowan, President of the Adirondack Sky Center and Observatory, described the object as a "very large misshapen orb" moving from west to north.</p>

<p>After a few moments of uncertainty, one of the astronomers present identified the object as a rocket. McGowan explained that the object was the result of solid booster rockets being jettisoned during the launch. The rocket was confirmed to have been launched from Cape Canaveral, while the Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium noted that another rocket was launched from French Guiana.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We all looked at it thinking it was a very strange thing to see in the sky. One of our astronomers, Gordie Duvall, after a few minutes he recognized it. It was a rocket that was launched.” 
    <footer>- Seth McGowan, President of the Adirondack Sky Center and Observatory</footer>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    “I’ve seen them coming up the East Coast at the right time in the evening where the rocket stage goes up into the sunlight and I can see the plume from the exhaust. It’s not too uncommon for this to happen.” 
    <footer>- Christian Bradley Hubbs, Planetarium Manager at Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium</footer>
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Rocket launches can often be observed from great distances, particularly when launched in the evening when sunlight illuminates the rocket's exhaust plume. The coincidence of two rocket launches occurring close together is not unusual in the field of aerospace, especially with multiple agencies conducting operations.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>There are currently no ongoing investigations into the sighting, as authorities have confirmed the object was a rocket. Local astronomers continue to engage the public in discussions about astronomical events and phenomena.</p>
