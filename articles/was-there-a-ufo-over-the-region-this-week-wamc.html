      <h2>Was there a UFO over the region this week?</h2>

<p>A bright object moving through the sky was seen across the eastern part of the U.S. on Tuesday night, surprising viewers who were watching the Perseid meteor shower. No injuries or fatalities have been reported.</p>

<p>The phenomenon has sparked interest and conversation among local astronomers and the public. Authorities have confirmed that the object was likely the result of two separate rocket launches occurring within a short timeframe, rather than an unidentified flying object.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Event occurred on Tuesday night, date not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Location: Eastern U.S., specific locations not disclosed.</li>
    <li>Witnesses included attendees of a meteor shower viewing led by Seth McGowan, President of Adirondack Sky Center and Observatory.</li>
    <li>The object was identified as solid booster rockets being jettisoned from a rocket launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida.</li>
    <li>A second rocket, the European Ariane 6, launched from French Guiana around the same time.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On Tuesday night, viewers gathered to witness the Perseid meteor shower. During this time, a bright object appeared in the sky, leading to speculation about its nature. Seth McGowan, who was present at the event, noted that the object was initially perceived as strange before being identified as a rocket.</p>

<p>McGowan reported that after a few minutes of observation, one of the astronomers recognized the object as the jettisoned solid booster rockets. This identification alleviated concerns among the watchers, who were initially excited by the possibility of seeing a UFO.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “From seemingly out of nowhere a very large misshapen orb seemed to be floating across the sky from the west heading north,” said Seth McGowan.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “It was actually a really interesting coincidence. There were two different rocket launches within about a half-hour of each other,” said Christian Bradley Hubbs, Planetarium Manager at the Fairbanks Museum and Planetarium.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Rocket launches can often be visible from great distances under the right conditions, particularly when they occur at night and are illuminated by sunlight. Previous incidents of similar nature have occurred, creating confusion among observers who mistake them for UFOs.</p>

<p>In recent years, increased interest in space exploration and rocket launches has led to more frequent sightings of such phenomena in the skies.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>No formal investigations are currently underway, as the events have been attributed to scheduled rocket launches. Observers are encouraged to continue enjoying astronomical events, such as the Perseid meteor shower, with the understanding that rocket launches may occasionally coincide with these occurrences.</p>
