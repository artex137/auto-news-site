      <h2>ESO’s Very Large Telescope Captures Rare Images & Video of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</h2>

<p>ESO’s Very Large Telescope (VLT) in Chile has captured images and video of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which was discovered on 1 July 2025. The comet, which is only the third confirmed interstellar object to enter the Solar System, was photographed two days after its discovery.</p>

<p>This event is significant as it provides astronomers with a rare opportunity to study material formed around another star. The VLT’s images and data are now accessible through the ESO archive, allowing researchers worldwide to analyze the comet further.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Discovery Date:</strong> 1 July 2025</li>
  <li><strong>Imaging Date:</strong> 3 July 2025</li>
  <li><strong>Location:</strong> ESO’s Very Large Telescope, Atacama Desert, Chile</li>
  <li><strong>Previous Interstellar Visitors:</strong> 1I/ʻOumuamua (2017), 2I/Borisov (2019)</li>
  <li><strong>Closest Approach to the Sun:</strong> 30 October 2025</li>
  <li><strong>Expected Reappearance:</strong> Early December 2025</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>On 1 July 2025, astronomers discovered comet 3I/ATLAS through the ATLAS survey. The VLT captured images of the comet on 3 July 2025, using its FORS2 instrument to record a sequence of images over approximately 13 minutes. The data were later compiled into a composite image highlighting the comet’s travel direction.</p>

<p>Following the VLT's observations, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged the comet in late July 2025. The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) followed suit in early August 2025. Additionally, NASA’s SPHEREx mission captured spectral data of the comet later that month.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>“This discovery adds to a short list of interstellar visitors, providing invaluable insights into the composition and behavior of material from beyond our Solar System,” said an ESO representative.</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS is notable for being only the third confirmed interstellar object to visit the Solar System, following 1I/ʻOumuamua in 2017 and 2I/Borisov in 2019. These interstellar comets offer scientists a glimpse into the formation of celestial bodies outside our Solar System.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Comet 3I/ATLAS will reach its closest approach to the Sun on 30 October 2025, after which it will be lost in solar glare and not observable from Earth. It is expected to reappear in early December 2025 as it moves away from the Sun, with a close approach to Earth anticipated in mid-to-late December. The comet poses no threat to our planet.</p>
