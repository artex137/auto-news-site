      <h2>Interstellar Object 3I/ATLAS Nucleus Size Specifications Explained</h2>

<p>Scientists have detected interstellar object 3I/ATLAS since July 2025, but its nucleus size remains a mystery. Researchers are currently analyzing telescope data and preparing spacecraft observations to determine the object's true size, activity, and composition.</p>

<p>This investigation is crucial for understanding the nature and origin of 3I/ATLAS. Authorities, including multiple space agencies, are employing various telescopes and spacecraft to gain insights into this interstellar visitor.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Detection Date:</strong> July 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Plume Size:</strong> 350,000 kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Composition of Plume:</strong> 87% carbon dioxide, 9% carbon monoxide, 4% water, traces of cyanide, and nickel without iron</li>
    <li><strong>Next Observation:</strong> Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on October 3, 2025</li>
    <li><strong>Jupiter Close Pass:</strong> March 16, 2026, within 54 million kilometers</li>
    <li><strong>Proposed Mission:</strong> Interstellar Comet Explorer (ICE) by Southwest Research Institute</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS was first detected in July 2025. Following this, telescopes like the Hubble Space Telescope and the Very Large Telescope have provided significant data about its gas plume and brightness. On July 21, 2025, Hubble captured an image revealing a sun-facing glow without a tail, suggesting that icy fragments may contribute to its brightness.</p>
<p>The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter is set to observe 3I/ATLAS on October 3, 2025, which will provide more precise measurements of its nucleus size. Additionally, the object is expected to pass near Jupiter on March 16, 2026, offering a unique opportunity for further observation.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>Avi Loeb, head of the Galileo Project, stated, "The plume could result from a natural icy body or from other processes, but current data cannot confirm the source."</blockquote>
<blockquote>Loeb also noted, "Knowing the nucleus size of 3I/ATLAS will clarify whether its activity is typical of natural comets or unusual."</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS is the third known interstellar visitor, following 1I/ʻOumuamua and 2I/Borisov. Understanding the nucleus size is essential for determining its mass and activity, as well as for comparing it with other interstellar comets and solar system comets. The ongoing research may reveal significant differences in characteristics between interstellar and solar system comets.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>Future observations from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and NASA's Juno spacecraft will be critical in refining the estimates of the nucleus size. Additional observations from various telescopes will continue to enhance understanding of 3I/ATLAS as it travels further into the solar system.</p>
