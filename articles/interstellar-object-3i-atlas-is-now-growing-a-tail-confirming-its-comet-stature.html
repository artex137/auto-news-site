      <h2>Interstellar object 3I/ATLAS is now growing a tail — confirming its comet stature</h2>

<p>The interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS has been observed growing a tail and developing a broad coma, according to recent images captured by astronomers at the Gemini South telescope in Cerro Pachón, Chile. This latest observation marks a significant development in understanding the comet's nature as it approaches the Sun.</p>

<p>This discovery is important for scientists studying interstellar objects, as it provides insights into the comet's age, origin, and components. The observations are part of a public outreach initiative organized by the US National Science Foundation's NOIRLab and allow students from Hawai‘i and La Serena, Chile, to participate in the research process.</p>

<h2>Key facts</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Object: Interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS</li>
    <li>Location of observation: Gemini South telescope, Cerro Pachón, Chile</li>
    <li>Significant features observed: Broad coma and a growing tail</li>
    <li>Tools used: Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS)</li>
    <li>Participating organizations: US National Science Foundation (NSF), NOIRLab, Instituto de Estudios Astrofísicos (IEA)</li>
    <li>Previous interstellar visitors: 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov</li>
</ul>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
<p>3I/ATLAS has been monitored since its discovery, with various telescopes capturing images over time. The latest observations have shown significant changes, including the growth of the comet's tail as it gets closer to the Sun.</p>

<p>The comet's tail emerged due to radiation pressure from the Sun, which pushes gas and dust away from the comet's nucleus. This indicates that the comet is behaving similarly to other known comets in our solar system.</p>

<h2>Official statements</h2>
<blockquote>
    “We were excited to see the growth of the tail, suggesting a change in the particles from the previous Gemini images, and we got our first glimpse of the chemistry from the spectrum,” stated Karen Meech, astronomer at the University of Hawai‘i Institute for Astronomy, according to NOIRLab.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
    “As 3I/ATLAS speeds back into the depths of interstellar space, this image is both a scientific milestone and a source of wonder,” Meech added.
</blockquote>

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>The observation of 3I/ATLAS follows the earlier discoveries of interstellar visitors 1I/’Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov. These objects have provided valuable information on the formation and evolution of planetary systems beyond our own.</p>

<p>Understanding the similarities between interstellar objects and comets within our solar system could enhance our knowledge of the processes involved in their formation.</p>

<h2>What’s next</h2>
<p>As 3I/ATLAS continues its journey, scientists will maintain observations using various telescopes to study its behavior and composition, contributing to a deeper understanding of interstellar bodies.</p>
