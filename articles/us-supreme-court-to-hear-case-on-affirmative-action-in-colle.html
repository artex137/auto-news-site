        <h2>Supreme Court to Review Affirmative Action</h2>
<p>The United States Supreme Court is set to hear a pivotal case regarding affirmative action in college admissions, which could significantly alter the landscape of higher education.</p>
<p>The case, which will be heard in the upcoming term, challenges the admissions policies of Harvard University and the University of North Carolina. Opponents argue that these policies discriminate against Asian American applicants, while supporters claim they are essential for maintaining diversity in educational institutions.</p>
<blockquote>“This case could redefine how colleges and universities approach admissions,” said legal expert Jane Smith.</blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court's decision could have far-reaching implications for affirmative action policies across the country, as many institutions rely on these practices to foster diverse student bodies.</p>
<p>The court's previous rulings on affirmative action have upheld the use of race as one of many factors in admissions decisions, but the current composition of the court raises questions about the future of these policies.</p>
