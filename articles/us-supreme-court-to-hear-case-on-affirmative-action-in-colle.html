        <h2>Supreme Court to Review Affirmative Action Policies</h2><p>The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear a significant case regarding affirmative action in college admissions, which could reshape the landscape of higher education across the country.</p><p>The case, which involves Harvard University and the University of North Carolina, challenges the legality of considering race as a factor in admissions decisions. Proponents argue that affirmative action is essential for promoting diversity and addressing historical inequalities, while opponents claim it discriminates against certain racial groups.</p><blockquote>“This case will determine whether colleges can continue to use race as a factor in admissions,” said legal expert Jane Doe. “The implications are vast and could affect institutions nationwide.”</blockquote><p>The Supreme Court's decision, expected in the summer of 2023, could overturn decades of precedent regarding affirmative action policies in education.</p>
