<h2>San Jose's Homeless Residents Stand Up Against City Hall's Brutality!</h2>

<p>In a shocking display of defiance, homeless residents from Columbus Park took to the streets of San José this week, staging a protest against the city's impending encampment sweep set for next Monday. This chaotic march from St. James Park to City Hall, which drew in over four dozen community activists and unhoused individuals, was a raw, emotional outpouring of frustration against the city’s heartless approach to homelessness. “Community engagement not abatement!” they chanted, their voices echoing through the halls of power, demanding recognition and humane treatment.</p>

<p>The protestors carried eye-catching signs emblazoned with powerful slogans like “Offer us housing” and “Homelessness is not a crime, folks are trying to survive,” clearly illustrating their plight and the urgent need for action. Among them was Rain, a resident of Columbus Park for a year and a half, who bravely shared her personal struggles. With corneas thinning and vision deteriorating, Rain bravely navigated her life on the streets while grappling with the looming threat of displacement. “It’s terrifying,” she told <em>San José Spotlight</em>. “It’s the second time I’ve been swept.” The callousness of the city’s actions is made all the more tragic by Rain’s disability, which has made accessing basic sanitation services and daily activities a Herculean task.</p>

<blockquote>
    “No one came to help... They just left me, kicked me out to the street with nothing and threw away all my stuff, all my important documents.” – Rain, Columbus Park resident
</blockquote>

<p>But the city’s plans for the homeless are not only inadequate; they are downright laughable! Promised shelters and services are delayed, with city officials admitting that three of the five hotels being converted into temporary housing won’t even open until late August! The so-called “safe sleeping site” on Taylor Street is not expected to be ready until September! This is an utter failure of leadership in Silicon Valley's largest city!</p>

<p>As if the situation wasn’t dire enough, the numbers paint a grim picture. According to the latest data shared by San Jose, the homeless population has surged to a staggering 6,503 individuals, up 237 from the previous year's count. Shockingly, about 60% of these individuals—3,959 people—are left to fend for themselves on the streets. Amanda Flores, a community organizer with West Valley Community Services, laid the harsh truth bare at the rally: “Let’s be clear here, Mayor (Matt) Mahan says there’s a place for everyone, but the math doesn’t lie.” She highlighted the stark reality that even with every tiny home and motel conversion fully operational, thousands will still be left abandoned, with nowhere to go!</p>

<blockquote>
    “We have nearly 4,000 unsheltered people in San Jose. Even after every tiny home, every motel conversion and the so-called navigation center are full, thousands will still be left with nowhere to go.” – Amanda Flores, Community Organizer
</blockquote>

<p>And what about the accountability? John Froggatt, a staff attorney at the Law Foundation of Silicon Valley, is bracing for the fallout from these encampment sweeps. “There will probably be a lot of property claims based on all the past instances, because people’s property ends up destroyed or just never heard from again,” Froggatt warned. Indeed, the city’s track record suggests a troubling pattern of negligence that will not go unchallenged. “Lawsuits are always on the table for certain violations of property,” he added ominously.</p>

<p>As the clock ticks down to the scheduled sweep, the residents of Columbus Park are left in a state of anxiety and despair. With the city’s promises of shelter and support falling woefully short, it begs the question: is San José truly committed to solving the homelessness crisis, or is this just a charade to sweep the issue under the rug? The community’s rallying cry is a desperate plea for compassion and understanding in the face of an increasingly hostile environment.</p>

<p>As we stand on the precipice of this impending disaster, one thing is clear: the homeless residents of San José will not go quietly into the night. They are fighting for their lives, their dignity, and their right to exist in a city that seems all too eager to push them aside. The spotlight is on San José, and it’s time for the city to step up, take responsibility, and prioritize the humanity of its most vulnerable citizens.</p>

<p>Stay tuned for updates on this developing story as we continue to monitor the situation and hold city officials accountable for their actions—or lack thereof. For more information, contact Joyce Chu at joyce@sanjosespotlight.com or follow her on X at @joyce_speaks.</p>
